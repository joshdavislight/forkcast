From Geth side, we feel very strongly that Frame Transactions are superior because it moves the problem completely to user space. We also want to bundle this with account abstraction because we see it overdue that users move to contract based wallets as first class citizens.

00:36:45	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Actually I have not-..."

Agent performance correlates almost perfectly with how much novel, non-public knowledge the project demands. ClawNews (CRUD) was effortless. ETH2030 (ZK primitives with barely any public documentation) required line-by-line guidance for anything beyond boilerplate.

We are discussing improvements to the protocol. We can’t have it all
00:37:14	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "Doing nothing seems ..."

“Doing nothing” is essentially “ship more EIPs”
00:37:23	Dustin:	Yeah it's not time-sensitive
00:37:26	Felix (Geth):	Replying to "There was another ..."

I understand that it requires an initial investment from the wallet side to support it
00:37:28	Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz:	Replying to "There was another EI..."

Frame tx sigs are not severable fro the data, see my crypto agility slides from PQTS #1.  If we are going to aggregate sigs they shouldn’t be in-line
00:37:39	lightclient:	Replying to "Doing nothing seems ..."

I don’t see them as equivalent
00:38:04	Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz:	Replying to "Doing nothing seems ..."

It’s more non-headliners vs a controvertial headliner
00:38:06	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "There was another EI..."

Do we really need to give signature abstraction power to users? When PQ comes don’t we just need a signature in the end? This might proliferate unsafe signature schemes
00:38:15	Justin Florentine (Besu):	we would still ship whatever EIPs are ready when FOCIL ships
00:38:21	Felix (Geth):	Replying to "There was another ..."

They don't have to be attached to the tx. It is feasible to remove VERIFY frames from transactions when they go into the block.
00:38:30	Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz:	Replying to "Doing nothing seems ..."

00:41:42	Dragan Rakita:	Replying to "There was another EI..."

This is full feedback: Frame Transactions introduce more account abstraction galaxy braining by delegating complexity into frames. Developers don't want to work with defining "frames". Reduces complexity in the sense that we don't need a "bundler" (which imo is like 5% of the problem of current AA landscape), but then introduces a ton of complexity on devtooling layer (both contracts and app devtools like viem), and makes account orchestration flows super difficult to reason about. Generally think accounts don’t need to be galaxy brained abstracted for 95% of real world users. Should enshrine native features for the 95% (a la. Tempo transactions), and escape hatch to account abstractions for the 5%.
00:42:15	Francesco:	Replying to "How long before were..."

Frame txs was recent but fairly advanced versions of native AA have existed for a long time and have received a lot of thought

00:43:56	Dustin:	For Nimbus, frame tx's are a fine fallback
00:44:05	Dragan Rakita:	Replying to "There was another EI..."

Imo listing what frame tx does, and doing exactly this concrete implementation would  give better results.
00:44:12	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "How long before were..."

00:58:03	Ansgar Dietrichs:	having worked on AA myself as well (EIP-2938, was rejected by acd in 2020), it seems clear that frame txs are the correct general purpose approach to enshrined AA.

my questions are just around timing, whether to ship in H-Star (open to it!) or later.
00:58:08	Dragan Rakita:	Replying to "also this https://gi..."

This is more for eip-7702 but point is there
00:58:43	Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz:	The first line of 8141 reads “This new transaction provides a native off-ramp from the elliptic curve based cryptographic system used to authenticate transactions today, to post-quantum (PQ) secure systems.” - based on what Matt is saying should it be moved off of the start?

01:02:32	Dustin:	One issue is current transaction types become combinatorial: characteristic A has 2 options (say, present or not present) and characteristic B has 3 options. then that's 6 tx types with current schema

This is why frame tx elides the data for VERIFY frames -> in the future we want to be able to aggregate signatures in protocol so that only a single witness for all txs is required

I think it is pretty easy to “remove” though since there isn’t introspection of it
01:18:46	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I personally would be more happy to embrace frame txs if we also were serious about moving the ecosystem over to AA for real. not just use it as pq insurance.

let’s make sure we have good standards for sponsored txs, batched txs, etc, all on top of AA. and then actually get all the dapps and all the wallets to add support for these, and on an attractive timeline, not “years”.

with that ambition, it would be my clear headliner favorite. as pq insurance only, a bit meh

having metamask/rabby/other big wallets support it on day 0
01:25:55	Derek Chiang:	As someone who has been building/selling ERC-4337 commercial solutions, gas sponsorship, transaction batching, and permissions (session keys) have been the biggest use cases of AA, way more than “new signature types.”  So AA standards that only add new signature types but don’t enable these other benefits are not worth considering, IMO

I don’t think day 0 support is always realistic. More wallets continue to support everyday. I see rainbow wallet is finally supporting 7702. This stuff takes time because every company has different priorities. The mainnet priorities don’t always match up with this. Many wallets already support smart accounts now thanks to 7702, so supporting 8141 is not a major lift at all

SETDELEGATE doesn’t bind to user address, it’s the contract address.  But perhaps a precompile to do it.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: Hello, hello, everyone, can you hear me?

2
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.630
Guillaume: Yup.

3
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect.

4
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, would we be ready to go live?

5
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.710
Josh Davis: Yeah, Renny, when you are.

6
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good? Then let's go live.

7
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.079
Josh Davis: You're alive. Take it away.

8
00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:36.909
Ansgar Dietrichs: Some good… hello, everyone. Welcome to another All Core Devs execution, number 231. Today will be mostly about continued H-star headliner discussion, but before we get into that, we have a few other

9
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:50.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: miscellaneous points, starting with Glams that are DevNets. First, I wanted to briefly ask about a update of the running DevNets. I think, Barnabas, you wanted to briefly say something?

10
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.850
Barnabas: Sure, so we currently have, 3 or 4 running the nets,

11
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.070
Barnabas: The current one is blob.net0, where we are testing, And the partial cloud stuff.

12
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:19.790
Barnabas: We have two clients onboarded, Lighthouse and Prysm. There are a few bugs here and there, some execution layer clients are failing to think to head. I will reach out to everyone that is affected.

13
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.940
Barnabas: Then we have, the big one, the blob devnet 2.

14
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.510
Barnabas: This is where we test the local level access list. We have onboarded Besu and Erigon, this week.

15
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:44.489
Barnabas: Besu has been, up to head since they've been, included, and Erigon, also failed to sink to head.

16
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.260
Barnabas: So we are still waiting on Erigon to…

17
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.469
Barnabas: be able to reach to the HUD.

18
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:57.759
Barnabas: I hope they can take a look, otherwise we're gonna be taking a look into that,

19
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.310
Barnabas: In the coming days.

20
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.599
Barnabas: We also have the NFT DevNet, 10.

21
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.449
Barnabas: Where we are testing 870.

22
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.780
Barnabas: It's a new P2P, protocol, that is, increasing the header size.

23
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.210
Barnabas: I think… And we have…

24
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.110
Barnabas: One more, the Pectra DevNet 3.

25
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.050
Barnabas: That just got relaunched, right now.

26
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:45.949
Barnabas: And, Perfect.net 3 also had an issue last week, where the whole chain just, halted, and we were unable to rescue it, so we are starting this table,

27
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.670
Barnabas: Over again, and, hopefully, we can actually succeed this time.

28
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.880
Barnabas: That's about it for visits.

29
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.839
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And then, I think there was some discussion about…

30
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:12.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: DevNet3 scope still. I'm not sure if there's anything specific to discuss today. Do we have anyone on the call that would want to bring up any topics regarding DevNet 3 scope?

31
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.969
Barnabas: Right, so, Blob DevNet 3 is scheduled to launch next week, Wednesday, and,

32
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.320
Barnabas: So is actually ePBS at, zero.

33
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.810
Barnabas: So that's a huge… Improvement, and we have a spec sheet for more than 3.

34
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.330
Barnabas: Just to keep it relevant for executioner clients.

35
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:44.219
Barnabas: So the idea was that we are going to introduce, 7954, which is the increased maximum contract size.

36
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:54.760
Barnabas: We're going to optionally, include 870, and optionally include 871 as the networking changes, and

37
00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:06.159
Barnabas: 8037 as a state creation gas cost increase, and the idea was that instead of having a dynamic value, we would introduce a static value increase only.

38
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.450
Ansgar Dietrichs: I see, and that one is final already?

39
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: That's still being discussed.

40
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:35.220
Barnabas: So the 8037, was raised on the 3rd this, Monday, and yeah, the idea was that we still want to do an increase, but, the testing, of the dynamic increase is very, very heavy, so instead of, doing that, we…

41
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.710
Barnabas: Decided to go with the static value increase, and

42
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:45.790
Barnabas: And just go with that for now, so that we can hit the deadline of next week, Wednesday, for the launch.

43
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.020
Barnabas: With some, hardcore devices.

44
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that seems very reasonable.

45
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.949
Barnabas: Maybe someone from the East team can chime in a bit more, regarding whether they have, got to the values that they want to use.

46
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: Spencer?

47
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.759
spencer: Yeah, so,

48
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:16.099
spencer: The hard-coded value, I cannot remember off the top of my head, but, it's whatever the value is when you plug in, 100 million as the block gas limit.

49
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.240
spencer: I can quickly, add this to the chat later.

50
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.110
spencer: I think last, on All Core Devs Testing as well.

51
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.530
spencer: I mentioned that we'd try and get tests out for today, but yeah, I think…

52
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.430
spencer: I think we'll be able to manage that tomorrow now.

53
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.790
spencer: And yeah, kind of an update on the 8037 tests is,

54
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:49.319
spencer: Yeah, we'll have, like, 8037-specific tests, all of the non-static tests in our repo filled for 8037, and…

55
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:55.700
spencer: Around 60% of the, ethereum, tests.

56
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.580
spencer: I guess, just to summarize as well, the issue here was…

57
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:16.039
spencer: that all of the legacy tests written in YAML, the logic required to actually update them for 1837 is not really feasible in YAML, so it's, forced us to actually finally port all these files into Python.

58
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.480
spencer: So we have a PR up for that as well now, so,

59
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:28.299
spencer: although this has taken us longer than expected, we have got quite a good… good win out… win out of it. But yeah, just to summarize,

60
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.870
spencer: Yeah, I think we'll try and get a release out tomorrow.

61
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.840
spencer: And I'll, post the value in 2 seconds.

62
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:52.079
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And with that somewhat reduced scope of the fixed values, do we now then have high confidence that we'll be able to get there and launch sometime next week, or is there still uncertainty on this, or…

63
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.859
spencer: I think… I think we'll be able to get a test release out by the end of tomorrow, so if,

64
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.640
spencer: I assume if clients are able to pass the test before Wednesday, then.

65
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.920
spencer: Should be okay.

66
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:20.629
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then, just the typical kind of uncertainty, of course, can always be that there's some last-minute holdups. Okay, awesome. This sounds great.

67
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.109
Ansgar Dietrichs: Any, any more DevNet-related comments?

68
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.190
Barnabas: That is it from me.

69
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.779
Barnabas: I think we can follow up on everything offline, if needed.

70
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:48.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Then, next up, we had two other miscellaneous, items. First, Sina wanted to briefly talk about, error E, and the current status there. Sina?

71
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.640
Sina Mahmoodi: Hey y'all. Yeah, I wanted to give a quick status update on Era E.

72
00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.020
Sina Mahmoodi: As you all know, it's the successor file format to error 1.

73
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:07.910
Sina Mahmoodi: It's… properly… Handles the transition epoch and post-merge history, so…

74
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:14.240
Sina Mahmoodi: In a sense, it will fully deprecate the error one format.

75
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:25.780
Sina Mahmoodi: As for major changes, it, like, post-merge, it will omit certain fields, like difficulty.

76
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.310
Sina Mahmoodi: There are also some structural changes, like…

77
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:41.339
Sina Mahmoodi: Entities in the file are grouped according to type instead of by block, which also necessitates a change in the index.

78
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.699
Sina Mahmoodi: As well as some encoding, differences, and…

79
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:53.790
Sina Mahmoodi: In the receipts, we also, omit the bloom field, which makes things more lightweight and simpler.

80
00:12:54.170 --> 00:13:04.430
Sina Mahmoodi: At this point, the… GEF has a, implementation nerged in.

81
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.360
Sina Mahmoodi: I believe Nimbus and other mines have,

82
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.800
Sina Mahmoodi: PRs, I… I… I'm hazy on the details of how far they are.

83
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:21.089
Sina Mahmoodi: And… I've… I'm sharing now in the chat

84
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.289
Sina Mahmoodi: A link to, basically, an overview doc where you can find a link to the spec, to the implementations.

85
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:41.949
Sina Mahmoodi: as well as exported files for Mainnet and Sepolia. So this should help with clients who want to implement this. And, right, I mean, we feel that the spec is in a stable enough

86
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.040
Sina Mahmoodi: Place.

87
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:51.639
Sina Mahmoodi: Where we would really like for clients to take a closer look, start implementing it, and give feedback.

88
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.189
Sina Mahmoodi: I'm happy to answer any questions.

89
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.359
Sina Mahmoodi: In the chat or after.

90
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good, thank you. Any synchronous questions? Anything important?

91
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.830
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise…

92
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:19.429
Ansgar Dietrichs: we can move on. This is a really important effort, thank you. The next up on the agenda, we have, the topic of

93
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:26.719
Ansgar Dietrichs: transaction pool namespace standardization, I think, Mercy, it is that you wanted to give an update on this, or bring it up.

94
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.260
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yit.

95
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:35.319
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, good afternoon. So, we've been reviewing some start PRs on JSNROP System.Course, and this is one of the PRs that we need,

96
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:51.250
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: core developers to look into. So, I had to open a new PRL, because this… the old one was, like, 2023, dating back then. So I would like to, get some input on this, although some clients have this already implemented. Things like,

97
00:14:51.630 --> 00:15:11.370
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: the filtering methods, has to… I feel like it needs to go through an AIP method, so I need to understand the right pathway to move on with… especially moving on with the filtering methods, and also how to, like, any other alternative suggestion in this. And also, Bessel has, like, a different naming space, but with the same,

98
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:18.090
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: standard form, so I don't know if that could be also changed.

99
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, Fabio?

100
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.839
Fabio Di Fabio: Hey, sorry, I have low voice today.

101
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.320
Fabio Di Fabio: So, I saw the proposal.

102
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:43.340
Fabio Di Fabio: I support them, and I think it's good to have a standardization in this part.

103
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:49.119
Fabio Di Fabio: And the… I think there is no issue for Besu to work

104
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.610
Fabio Di Fabio: And expose also this, standard API.

105
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.570
Fabio Di Fabio: There are a few comments I left on the PR.

106
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.149
Fabio Di Fabio: Also, please review them.

107
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.550
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, I'll address that shortly.

108
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:05.980
Fabio Di Fabio: Thanks.

109
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:18.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good, yeah, that seems like a general useful thing. Messi, is there anything you'd think we would need to discuss synchronously now, or is this just otherwise something where clients can comment?

110
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:35.459
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, they can, comment on, the PR itself, and also for the new featuring methods on, transaction… TxPools and transaction and TxPool statistics, which is from the original proposal. So, I don't know if I'm supposed to, like,

111
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.200
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: upload an EIP proposal for that, or we can just, like, include them into this PR already.

112
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:53.079
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that's a good question. I think we can… that can be discussed in the PR. I wouldn't know out of the top of my head.

113
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:02.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, awesome. I thought there was a raised hand, maybe briefly, Marius, but, yeah.

114
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:20.570
Marius van der Wijden: I just, I realized at some point that these methods are not super helpful anymore, because we have such a lot of transactions in the transaction pool, or some… some of these methods. Like, the methods that print all of the transactions.

115
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:32.630
Marius van der Wijden: not really… like, they just print out way too much stuff. So, I like the… there are some of these that only print out a…

116
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:38.830
Marius van der Wijden: a certain, Thought form…

117
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:45.420
Marius van der Wijden: Summary of what's in the transaction pool, and then there are some that just print out everything in the transaction pool.

118
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.840
Marius van der Wijden: Maybe, a method that is, like, filter the transaction pool for this transaction hash, or…

119
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.469
Marius van der Wijden: For all transactions from this address might be…

120
00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:03.819
Marius van der Wijden: More interesting than just giving me all of the content of the transaction pool, and then the content is, like.

121
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.630
Marius van der Wijden: 4,000 transactions.

122
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.590
Ansgar Dietrichs: Felix?

123
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:30.970
Felix (Geth): I think for us right now, it's just more about getting the… started with this API. If we want to have it changed, we can definitely iterate on the PR. This proposal is just more about getting any API standardized, because right now, it's not standardized at all, and it's still

124
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:36.750
Felix (Geth): This namespace is anyway more for debugging and testing.

125
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:48.609
Felix (Geth): And less for the production use. I don't think it really makes sense for any RPC provider, for example, to support this method, and apps aren't supposed to use it either. It's just for us to be able to check

126
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:59.099
Felix (Geth): certain properties in the DevNet and things like that. Or, if you are an advanced user, I don't know, but it doesn't really seem like a user-focused API.

127
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:06.139
Felix (Geth): And so for that reason, I would say just exporting the full content or exporting all the hashes is…

128
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.130
Felix (Geth): Kind of what we want.

129
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:14.429
Felix (Geth): Because it gives you a full snapshot of what's the transaction pool like right now, and then you can…

130
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.390
Felix (Geth): Figure out some other tooling on top, or…

131
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:33.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense, yeah, then it sounds like maybe a discussion point there should be whether to just standardize the, kind of, this… this existing scope,

132
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:50.789
Ansgar Dietrichs: first, and then think about extensions later, or whether to maybe just take some more time and have a more up-to-date, useful kind of version to standardize, but yeah, I think this can… that concrete discussion can happen asynchronously. But sounds like overall people all agree that the standardization effort is useful.

133
00:19:52.540 --> 00:20:02.999
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Then I think we can move on. The next section, and last section is the Hegota headquarta…

134
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:20.029
Ansgar Dietrichs: Headliner topic, before we go into the actual, client positions and, discussion, there was a update, specifically the, headliner proposal, EIP8105.

135
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.429
Ansgar Dietrichs: Which,

136
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:46.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: was the, what was the exact name? The, Universal Enshrined Encrypted Mempool. So we had, just to remind people, we had two separate encrypted mempool proposals this time around as headliner. One was this, the, the, the, the first one, the older one, basically, EIP8105, Universal Enshrined Encrypted Mempool, and then, relatively shortly before the deadline, we had a second one.

137
00:20:46.030 --> 00:21:09.999
Ansgar Dietrichs: called, Lucid. And now, in particular, a couple days ago, the, champions of the, of the first one, 8105, had a comment, that they are basically withdrawing their EIP as a headliner proposal, and instead are basically endorsing, Lucid. So now we have one, combined, enshrined, sorry, encrypted mempool.

138
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.059
Ansgar Dietrichs: proposal, so that's an update there. I'm not sure if anyone from the 8105 team is on the call, would want to say a few words on this, or… otherwise, I guess it's…

139
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: Self-explanatory. Yannick?

140
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:29.489
Jannik Luhn: Yeah, I think you explained it very well. That's basically the situation. We threw it in favor of supporting Lucid, just to make the decision a bit easier for everyone else.

141
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:48.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And there is the question shared which EIP is the Lucid one. I also looked into this, I couldn't, like, I think it's… there's maybe not yet a merged EIP? Is this… I don't know, is anyone from the Lucid team on the call can briefly talk about the EIP status of Lucid?

142
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:58.299
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yes, Anders just spoke to that in the chat, it's still in a draft stage, it's gonna be shared over the weekend.

143
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good.

144
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:16.049
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Then with that, I think we can, move on to the actual, headliner discussion. So, last week we… oh, no, last call, two weeks ago,

145
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:25.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: asked for clients to basically think about what their positions would be on the individual headliners. Some of the clients

146
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:40.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: posted some official kind of document or statement of any form on the agenda. I wanted to go through those first. First up, I think we had Erigon with a brief comment. Is anyone from Erigon here to briefly summarize this?

147
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: Give some context.

148
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.800
andrew (erigon): Yeah, sure. So, can you hear me?

149
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.150
andrew (erigon): It's, basically… Yes, we can.

150
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: AU.

151
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:58.749
andrew (erigon): what, what, what I wrote is that we think, both account abstraction and encrypted mempos are

152
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:06.739
andrew (erigon): Well, very important, and it's crucial to prevent, front-running, but because, there is,

153
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:16.819
andrew (erigon): This extensive roadmap, the straw map, that affects, slot times, and,

154
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.390
andrew (erigon): how… how transactions are mapped into slots and things like that. It might be…

155
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:35.369
andrew (erigon): fine, okay, to delay Lucid until the iHeart walk, so that we have more time to… to, like, double-check that it agrees with everything else on the roadmap.

156
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:42.329
andrew (erigon): Yeah, basically that's it, but we would like to see both, of course, both the account abstraction and

157
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.889
andrew (erigon): the encrypted memo in Ethereum.

158
00:23:49.560 --> 00:24:00.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Then, next up, we had, a document from the Besu team. Anyone from BASU want to briefly summarize?

159
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.410
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): Yeah, I… I can do that. So…

160
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:10.179
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): The Besu team is in favor of having Lucid as the EL headliner.

161
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.460
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): We think it's an ideal candidate to go together with Fossil.

162
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:25.550
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): Specifically because without something like this, Fossil will only be useful for transactions that

163
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.280
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): Cannot… that don't have any math to be extracted, or that are not very time-sensitive.

164
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.329
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): So it might only benefit a small minority of users.

165
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:43.090
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): I like, for example, Fossil a lot, but most of my transactions I have to send to a private land pool, so none of my transactions are available

166
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.080
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): be picked up by… by… by an included.

167
00:24:46.450 --> 00:25:04.150
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): That's why I think that we, the team in general, also likes the frame transactions, it's just if we have to prioritize between Lucid and the frame transactions, we prefer Lucid because it's an ongoing problem that has plagued Ethereum for many, many years.

168
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:14.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Next up, we had, the guest team. Anyone from guest wants to briefly summarize?

169
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:31.639
lightclient: They… Yep, so… we posted our document. We feel that Frame Transactions is the best choice for

170
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:38.520
lightclient: the headliner for Hagota. We also think that it's a good… fit for…

171
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:49.940
lightclient: Fossil on the CL side. Fossil's going to give better inclusion guarantees to transactions in the protocol, and we feel that smart accounts also deserve to

172
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:56.000
lightclient: Take advantage of… The improved, those improved inclusion guarantees.

173
00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:03.120
lightclient: the… For the other headliners, 7807SSZ.

174
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.800
lightclient: It's a nice change, I think.

175
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.630
lightclient: We feel it's just too invasive for the benefit to users right now.

176
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:20.830
lightclient: And we also believe that there's a lot of experimentation that can be done on the engine API without changing the consensus representation of the objects.

177
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.720
lightclient: So we would prefer to start there.

178
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:31.729
lightclient: And the Lucid encrypted mempool is also an interesting idea. We just don't think that it's matured enough yet.

179
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:38.479
lightclient: it… You know, encrypted mempools haven't really been deployed widely in blockchain systems yet.

180
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:48.559
lightclient: And the… The instances that have been deployed leak metadata, things like nonsense, gas limits, data sizes.

181
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.499
lightclient: And this is also an issue in Lucid.

182
00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:08.270
lightclient: So we worry a bit about what type of information can be gleaned from that metadata. So, we would like to see more significant discussion around it, and prototyping of the project over the next 6 to 12 months, and consider,

183
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.450
lightclient: considered as a headliner in Istanbul, potentially.

184
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.270
lightclient: Yep, I think that's all for us.

185
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:24.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And then, there was another comment by NMUCL, but maybe to first round of the,

186
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:44.529
Ansgar Dietrichs: the main production EL clients first. We did not have a official comment from… on the agenda from either Reth or Nethermind, but I have seen that there was active discussion, so I know those clients also have positions. Do we have anyone from Nethermind on the call that could briefly summarize the team position on this?

187
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:58.820
Łukasz Rozmej: Yes, I can summarize, so we didn't put out any official statement, because after discussions, we weren't completely convinced about, any of the APs.

188
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:09.100
Łukasz Rozmej: So, we do like, the privacy that Lucid brings, we do like the… especially the road to…

189
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:20.010
Łukasz Rozmej: Different signatures with the frame transactions, but both bring, in our opinion, such big complexity that we are not…

190
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:27.000
Łukasz Rozmej: really, at the current moment, confident to just support them.

191
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.430
Łukasz Rozmej: So…

192
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:39.250
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, we are still… we are open to be convinced yet, but we are not convinced at the moment that any of them is actually 100% correct way to go.

193
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:47.490
Łukasz Rozmej: Mostly due to the complexity of both, of both, of both.

194
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:52.540
Łukasz Rozmej: proposals. We are… we are afraid about the complexity creep.

195
00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:01.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And as Nixu was mentioning in chat, and then also Marius, actually, in his own personal opinion,

196
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:13.140
Ansgar Dietrichs: there is indeed also the option to just not choose an EL-specific headliner. We already, with Fossil, obviously have a main headliner, and it does touch the EL. So maybe then I would…

197
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:24.670
Ansgar Dietrichs: summarize the Nethermine position as a preference for no yellow headliner, although it does sound like you could be convinced still for any of the other headliners, maybe with some iteration or things like that.

198
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:35.449
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome, and then actually, from my understanding, from just reading the chat, was maybe that the Reth position could be similar, but do we have anyone from Reth on the call that could briefly speak to that?

199
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.530
Dragan Rakita: Yeah, I think I'm here. Yeah.

200
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:55.870
Dragan Rakita: From this list of AIPs, yeah, it's hard to choose anybody, anything to be a headliner.

201
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.430
Dragan Rakita: You can frame trisection.

202
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:05.320
Dragan Rakita: Feels, like, over-engineered for the…

203
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:12.790
Dragan Rakita: Solution that we basically could do as some simpler… Implementation.

204
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.770
Dragan Rakita: Encrypted pools, seems torely to add them.

205
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.980
Dragan Rakita: And S is the… yeah.

206
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.399
Dragan Rakita: There is not a lot of benefit, like, doing a lot amount of work.

207
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.949
Dragan Rakita: Not that great of the benefits.

208
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:41.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So yeah, then it's a similar take on possibly considering having a new headliner.

209
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, sounds good. Andrew?

210
00:30:45.470 --> 00:31:03.879
andrew (erigon): Yeah, I'd like to address the point on complexity. Well, when I saw the straw map, I initially thought that it was a little bit too ambitious and too optimistic, but now I'm actually reconsidering, because… because of plot 4.6,

211
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:10.289
andrew (erigon): We've been having some internal discussions within the team, and…

212
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:19.489
andrew (erigon): And we've been impressed how well it can handle everyone's call base, and probably similar for Nethermind.

213
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:39.350
andrew (erigon): As well, and the rest. So, and it's, like, something like, well, not necessarily Claude, maybe Gemini, whatnot, but I think now we are getting really powerful tools to help us with, turning the, the… this ambitious roadmap into… into reality.

214
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.009
andrew (erigon): It can help us with,

215
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:56.620
andrew (erigon): implementation with, like, as, like, done with the spec writing, with, test writing, and so on. It's not a silver bullet, of course, but I think it can do a lot of,

216
00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.210
andrew (erigon): Verification, and

217
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:07.880
andrew (erigon): kind of nitpicking job and things like that. It's really… it's really a big productivity boost, which…

218
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:21.050
andrew (erigon): improved significantly within the last, like, two months. So, yeah, I'm kind of not that worried about complexity. We have… we have now, we have some powers to tackle it.

219
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:41.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Can we maybe briefly round up the, just going through the client positions before we go into discussion? But, but yeah, this is a comment well taken. Also, maybe, Andas, if you maybe have a more process-related comment, I think it's fine now, but otherwise, in terms of open discussion, I would briefly hold off.

220
00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:57.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, just so we can briefly finish, because there was also the Nimbus EL position, I can also link that. Do we have anyone from Nimbus on the call to briefly summarize that?

221
00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.119
Dustin: Sure, yeah, so…

222
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:13.050
Dustin: I guess, perhaps unsurprisingly, we're in favor of moving towards SSZ, and, and in a couple of concrete ways. So, I think we…

223
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.960
Dustin: So…

224
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:27.960
Dustin: We actually think SSC can complement, two of the EIPs here, and so frame transactions, we are in favor of frame transactions, though, and frame transactions would be even better with SSC, and in particular.

225
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:43.730
Dustin: This is not a completely arbitrary point, as in, you know, anything can be better with SSC, but this is a point of, frame transactions highlight one of the costs of not transitioning to SSC in a timely way, because they are essentially adding, sort of, instant tech debt.

226
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.550
Dustin: From the outset.

227
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:54.680
Dustin: More transac… you know, another transaction type, more formats to parse, to code, and there will be multiple representations of these now.

228
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.020
Dustin: if…

229
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:11.100
Dustin: And we are obviously proposing approaches to avoid this, but even separately from 7807, incorporating that into frame transactions, we feel would be an improvement.

230
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.280
Dustin: Otherwise, as far as

231
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:23.930
Dustin: Frame transactions, we find, are… address a fair amount of… a wide range of problems relatively elegantly, as far as that goes, that are…

232
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:31.320
Dustin: Worth addressing, and in particular, a number of feature-proofing aspects.

233
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:41.519
Dustin: And finally, for encrypted mempools especially, I want to say, before the consolidation, before Lucid, sort of became the…

234
00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:47.009
Dustin: the one, that was… I think we found it sort of un…

235
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:55.649
Dustin: unappealing, let's say, to have, and indicative of an immature EIP or a spec.

236
00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:13.579
Dustin: ecosystem consensus, that there were two different, headliners, which were actually have somewhat, somewhat different approaches, and that suggested that there simply needed to be more time. So, encrypted mempools are nice, but I don't think they're quite ready yet for, for,

237
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.210
Dustin: For this fork.

238
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.060
Dustin: Yeah.

239
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.940
Dustin: What's up?

240
00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.460
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then,

241
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:37.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: before we go into, yeah, open discussion, just in just one second, so basically, I think my summary of these positions would be that we have some, individual support for both Lucid and SSC,

242
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:48.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: But that the two primary positions that seem to be… have mentioned the most were either to do frame transactions, which I think had the most individual support.

243
00:35:48.270 --> 00:36:04.990
Ansgar Dietrichs: or to consider just not having an EL-specific, headliner, which had a bit less support, but also considerable support, so it looks like it might be trending towards a decision between those two options. But yeah, again, that's what we'll…

244
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:29.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: we're here to discuss. In terms of process, just to mention, I think, timeline-wise, if we can get to consensus today, we can make a decision today. We don't have to. If it turns out that we actually, like, are split between two options in the end, we can also take two more weeks. By next call is when we would really want to lock in the decision at the latest. So, with that as context, I think we can open the discussion. Justin, you have your hand up?

245
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:42.610
Justin Florentine (Besu): I just would like to maybe ask us to… maybe you could take a discussion point, Asgard? I'm very curious as to Dustin's point, I think it's very interesting, and would love to discuss that later, like, what does it mean to have

246
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:50.569
Justin Florentine (Besu): two EIPs that do similar things in different ways propose as headliners. Is that a bug or a feature? Like, I could go either way on that. I think it's…

247
00:36:50.570 --> 00:37:01.319
Justin Florentine (Besu): A very interesting point that's raised there, and I'd like to… us not to lose it, and maybe… maybe consider that as an example of, you know, maybe there's a process adjustment here. So, that's all.

248
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.989
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that makes sense. I would maybe keep that…

249
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:23.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: out of scope for today's call, like, the… the… what… I think… I think this is better for, like, once we have it logged in the headliner, we can talk about what went well, what went not so well, what can we improve for future headliner processes, but… but point well taken. Yeah, do we… do we have other…

250
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:35.109
Ansgar Dietrichs: comments, I see in chat people arguing that maybe it's a waste to not have a headliner,

251
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.380
Ansgar Dietrichs: There's other comments. Anyone wants to bring up something?

252
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.660
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I would counter that by… just by saying…

253
00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:03.059
Marius van der Wijden: not choosing an EL headliner doesn't mean we cannot choose any ELPs. It just means…

254
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:17.210
Marius van der Wijden: like, I think there's a different difference in understanding what the headliner means, but for me personally, it means that this is the feature that we would consider delaying the fork over if it's not ready.

255
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:25.509
Marius van der Wijden: And I don't… necessarily see any of the features that we… that are proposed.

256
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:40.189
Marius van der Wijden: important enough and well thought out enough to be in that stage. So I would prefer not to have an EL headline, and then just do as many EL EAPs, other EL EAPs that we… that we can, and if we…

257
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:51.709
Marius van der Wijden: if we see that FOCIL is taking longer, we can add more. If possible is very fast, then we can pull out some of those, non-head learner AIPs again.

258
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:08.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense. So in terms of… I'm mostly curious to what extent we feel like we are at least close enough to iterating towards a decision that it's worth trying to get there today.

259
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:18.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: Emm… Maybe first off, How do people feel about the non-favorite,

260
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:31.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: proposed solutions. So, again, we have… we had some support for Lucid, some support for SSC, but at least in the first round of, statements, it didn't seem like they would… they were close to, sufficient,

261
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:49.989
Ansgar Dietrichs: support. So the question is, for example, do we… are they a lot of people's secret second option, and they still have a good chance of convincing people? Is it maybe, already clear that we can make a decision today to not consider the mid-side lineup going forward?

262
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:56.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, let's maybe start there, like, do clients have… Concrete takes on those two.

263
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anders?

264
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:15.789
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, could I just ask the GET team about this? All encryptum impulse we are aware of suffer from substantial metadata leakage, but we don't think that Lucid leaks metadata, so maybe they could clarify that.

265
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:23.400
lightclient: I mean, Lucid leaks, gas limit, gas price… This is metadata.

266
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.250
Anders Elowsson: How does it leak?

267
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.780
lightclient: I mean, is this not in the plain text of the transaction envelope?

268
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:44.979
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, but… but you don't, reveal which transact… which… which account you are,

269
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:49.270
Anders Elowsson: going to send from. So you just specify a gas estimate first.

270
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:53.900
lightclient: Yeah, but this is the metadata. I mean, that's what the definition of metadata is.

271
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.439
Anders Elowsson: I don't agree with that. I don't agree with the definition of neopurata.

272
00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.479
lightclient: I mean, we don't need to get caught up in these details, I think, that…

273
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.949
lightclient: It was said nicely earlier, where there were two different proposals for encrypted mempools, both proposed at the last moment.

274
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.509
lightclient: This is not ready for Hakota.

275
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:17.540
lightclient: I think it could be ready for I-Star, but it was not picked as the headliner for any client except Besu.

276
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.009
lightclient: I don't see this.

277
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.650
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, I mean, it's perfectly…

278
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:21.650
lightclient: Proposed that's ready.

279
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.560
Anders Elowsson: Perfect.

280
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:28.380
Anders Elowsson: It's a perfectly valid position, I just wanted to specify that we do not leak metadata.

281
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:34.540
Anders Elowsson: And I don't agree with the, with, that… that we do.

282
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: feelings.

283
00:41:44.540 --> 00:42:00.769
Felix (Geth): just to interject here, I think we have to solve this offline. So, this specific statement, we can figure it out, but I don't think we're gonna resolve it live right here. So, let's just open a thread in the Discord.

284
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.400
Felix (Geth): And… Discuss it there after the call.

285
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that specific issue, I agree.

286
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:27.780
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, okay, let me do it this way. I think both, the Besu team with support for Lucid had indicated that they, as a second op choice, would, also, appreciate frame transactions as a headliner, and Nimbus EL had also mentioned that they also, indeed also,

287
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:47.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: were otherwise in favor of frame transactions, so it sounds like both of those teams that supported a non-majority headliner candidate were at least, in principle, okay with an alternative headliner. Is this an accurate summary? Basically, are any of these teams… would any of these teams try to die on the hill of their specific proposal?

288
00:42:49.910 --> 00:43:02.439
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): I think from Westside, we would not die on the hill, but at least I think we would need to talk in this new case between frame transaction and no headliner.

289
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:09.409
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): what we want to support, because we had at least one… one person on the team who also was… didn't want any headliner.

290
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:17.219
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): So I could not commit to frame transaction if it's between those two today, on the core. We will need to do this async.

291
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:25.970
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense. Yeah, Andrew?

292
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:32.359
andrew (erigon): Yeah, I think no headliner would be… would be a waste.

293
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.920
andrew (erigon): So, like…

294
00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:52.510
andrew (erigon): from our perspective, we are happy to do either the frame transactions for Lucid in Habitat. I think if we do Lucid, we're just, like, the only reservation is that we take time to double-check that

295
00:43:52.910 --> 00:44:05.870
andrew (erigon): It agrees nicely with all the things on the straw map, and adjusts I diluted or the items on the straw map accordingly, but, like, no, like, things we can pull it off for Hagota.

296
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:12.660
andrew (erigon): Yeah, I just… I think no headliner is the least without options.

297
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: Felix?

298
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:31.350
Felix (Geth): I just wanted to give a quick comment that I think also there has been a lot of discussion in the comments here on the call about the frame transaction proposal, and it might make sense to just organize a breakout call. I don't really know how these…

299
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.170
Felix (Geth): How it works with the breakouts?

300
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.290
Felix (Geth): I mean…

301
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:46.499
Felix (Geth): But, like, just having a one-off breakout where we really figure out the details of the proposal, like, why we made certain choices, if, you know, people have

302
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:52.210
Felix (Geth): some… problems with it, I think that could really help.

303
00:44:54.370 --> 00:45:02.259
Felix (Geth): because I'm still seeing a lot of confusion, like, people saying, oh yeah, can we do this, like, another way, or is this really what we should be doing now? And, like, this is…

304
00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.350
Felix (Geth): Sweet.

305
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:12.469
Felix (Geth): it would just be good to, like, clarify once and for all, like, what is this proposal, why is this there, what are the alternatives, and so on. It's not so easy to…

306
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.809
Felix (Geth): To just do it all here on the call, and especially not in the comments.

307
00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:27.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right so Barnabas in chat has the comment that he'd prefer to dive into it now. I…

308
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:43.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: personally think a breakout does make sense, especially if some teams say that they wouldn't feel comfortable committing to anything today either way, but yeah, of course, if the majority of people would want to just actually do a 45-minute frame transaction deep dive now, we could do that now.

309
00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: Not sure how people feel about that.

310
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:57.700
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I just thought maybe we have other stuff on the agenda, like, usually we don't, like, do these deep dives on ACD, it's just more about the decision-making. We can totally do it, I mean, it's just a question of if this is what people want.

311
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:09.589
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. We don't have anything further on the agenda other than this decision. I'm mostly just worried that not everyone on the technical side from each client that actually might be interested in this is on the call right now.

312
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: but,

313
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:30.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I mean, process-wise, it feels more clean to actually have a pre-announced breakout. I would just lean towards making that decision, but again, if many people here would actually want to do it now.

314
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:33.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: Happy to be overruled.

315
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:52.029
lightclient: I mean, I feel like we should just talk about frame transactions, since that seems to be a major sticking point for people.

316
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:58.339
lightclient: I'm not sure if it's the same questions or issues for every person, though.

317
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:14.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, sure, I mean, Ben, I'm happy to give the floor to…

318
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:18.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: the frame transaction people to have a…

319
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.019
Ansgar Dietrichs: Kind of a bit of a deep dive session right now.

320
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.550
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds like people…

321
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:25.920
Marius van der Wijden: Sure.

322
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: Prefer this?

323
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.549
Marius van der Wijden: Should we just… should we just do the rest of the agenda?

324
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.820
Marius van der Wijden: Like…

325
00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:35.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: But there is no rest of the agenda. The rest of the agenda was specifically that just, like, the headline

326
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.789
Ansgar Dietrichs: Last point of the agenda.

327
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.479
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, maybe we can just ask, are there any topics that

328
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:47.480
Marius van der Wijden: Still need to be discussed before we dive deep into the last 45 minutes or something?

329
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.410
Marius van der Wijden: Frame transactions?

330
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:59.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, so is there anything non-headliner related? Because in terms of, like, other thoughts around headliners, I think…

331
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:05.950
Ansgar Dietrichs: That then… it's the same category, but anything not non-headliner related that people would want to discuss today, otherwise.

332
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:24.940
Anders Elowsson: Is there any chance for me to say one thing before that discussion? I just wanted to talk about the options

333
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:30.879
Anders Elowsson: the… when we… when we say that no headliner, I think we should, maybe…

334
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:40.759
Anders Elowsson: talk a little bit about what that means, because there are certain, sort of, slightly big ELPs that we could do that…

335
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:53.709
Anders Elowsson: I feel also could be worthwhile, and I would just like to flag, before you go into the frame transaction discussion, about EIP7999. Because, just because I feel that,

336
00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:07.909
Anders Elowsson: when we do… we are currently doing 8037, and it feels slightly brittle to me, the way… the way it is designed, because we're trying to predict, essentially, demand elasticity, instead of going, like, by measured demand.

337
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:22.590
Anders Elowsson: And the thing is that if these predictions turn out to be wrong, we will sort of impede scaling. And it has been worrying me for quite a long time, so I just wanted to flag that if we have more space and more time to do 7999 instead.

338
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:33.759
Anders Elowsson: then I think this would also be a worthwhile thing to do. So that was just what I wanted to say. And in this case, we would do a very small 7999, but we would do it with state as one of the…

339
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.790
Anders Elowsson: resources.

340
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:43.339
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, that's a reasonable comment. So, indeed, like, no headliner doesn't just mean… just…

341
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:54.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: kind of do nothing, wasted space, like, it could either enable a faster poke, or it could just give more room for… I don't know, ambitious non-headliner ERPs. That is correct.

342
00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:12.869
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, with that said, then I think we can go into frame transactions. I think I would timebox it to maybe-ish 30 minutes, so that at the end we can have a few more minutes to just talk about is, did this discussion get us to a point where we'd be ready to make a headline decision, or if not.

343
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:25.169
Ansgar Dietrichs: and basically just make sure we are aligned on next steps for our next call. So… but yeah, 30 minutes for… up to 30 minutes for frame transactions, if anyone from the frame transaction side wants to take the lead for that section of the call.

344
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:27.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: The flow would be yours.

345
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:31.899
lightclient: Yeah, I mean, I think it… Okay, go ahead, Felix.

346
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.880
Felix (Geth): Just wanted to quickly say that I can,

347
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:44.879
Felix (Geth): I mean, we are both here, Matt and I, I think we are the representatives of this EAP, so we are both happy to host it and answer the questions.

348
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:46.470
Felix (Geth): that come up.

349
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:52.229
Felix (Geth): So I would do it, like, more in a question-and-answer style way.

350
00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:59.179
Felix (Geth): Like, personally, if people have specific points, we can go through these points.

351
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:03.029
Felix (Geth): Anyway, Matt, you also wanted to say something, so…

352
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:10.729
lightclient: Yeah, no, I was gonna say basically the same thing. I think we talked… we went over a pretty high level how frame transactions worked a couple calls ago.

353
00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:18.890
lightclient: It's also similar to things that have existed for a few years, so I think that people kind of get it, and it would probably just be better to talk about the…

354
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.460
lightclient: The specific questions or concerns that people have.

355
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.400
lightclient: About the proposal.

356
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:55.410
lightclient: So, the clients who chose not to have frames as the headliner, What would convince you otherwise?

357
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.250
lightclient: Okay, people are shy to talk.

358
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:12.230
Felix (Geth): I think that's a pretty strange one to start off with, like, I mean, we're not really here to, like, you know.

359
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:23.499
Felix (Geth): I don't know, I would rather say… so we had specific points raised in the comments. If I scroll up a little bit, what I can see is that… so we had one concern, which is regarding the dev tooling.

360
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.120
Felix (Geth): So,

361
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:38.219
Felix (Geth): Dargan from Reth was saying, frame transactions become a nightmare for dev tooling. Feedback we got is that it's over-abstracted, and a simpler solution would be more powerful.

362
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:43.600
Felix (Geth): Later, he follows it up with, comment saying…

363
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:58.479
Felix (Geth): Full feedback, frame transactions introduce more account abstraction galaxy braining by delegating complexity into frames. Developers don't want to work with defining frames, reducing complexity in the sense that we don't need a bundler.

364
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:04.490
Felix (Geth): but then introduce toner complexity and dev code dueling layer, for example, in VM.

365
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:10.679
Felix (Geth): And, account abstraction flows are super difficult to reason about, specifically with this.

366
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.150
Felix (Geth): frames.

367
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:18.620
Felix (Geth): So, I think this is something… this is one of the points we could focus on. Wukash, do you have something to say?

368
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:26.350
Łukasz Rozmej: I would like to ask, what's the main, goal we want to achieve? Because,

369
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:43.440
Łukasz Rozmej: Frame transactions was also sold as going to different signature schemes, and it's also a transaction, so do we want to, like, hit two birds with one stone, or what do we want to achieve here? Or what's the main goal?

370
00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:51.299
Felix (Geth): Yeah, this might be a good thing to, like, get into first. So, for me personally, I can answer it, like.

371
00:53:51.470 --> 00:54:00.760
Felix (Geth): I think that… The immediate goal we have is to solve the transaction signature issue, let's call it that.

372
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.279
Felix (Geth): And so the issue that we see is just that

373
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:11.430
Felix (Geth): there is no way to originate an Ethereum transaction without creating an ECDSA signature right now.

374
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:23.140
Felix (Geth): So now you could say, well, let's just fix that specific thing, but it goes a little bit further than that, because even if we introduce another transaction type that just…

375
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:35.860
Felix (Geth): has another kind of signature on it, then we're kind of back to the same problem, because the protocol uses ECDSA signatures on the specific curve in other ways, so then we would have to address those as well, and then…

376
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.160
Felix (Geth): That doesn't even get into all the advanced use cases that people have.

377
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:50.110
Felix (Geth): So, we just feel like we have to put a good and general solution to this problem that is basically gonna last us for all time.

378
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:59.470
Felix (Geth): And so that just means for us that we just have to remove transaction signatures from the protocol completely, which is what this proposal does. So there is no more

379
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.090
Felix (Geth): And shrine signatures at all with frame transactions.

380
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:12.090
Łukasz Rozmej: Okay, so I was looking into some alternatives, similar to that, and there was this EAP79… Free, too.

381
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:24.900
Łukasz Rozmej: that kind of did that with, like, an envelope transaction that had the inner transaction in it, while having a different signature scheme. It wasn't…

382
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.610
Łukasz Rozmej: relatively simple solution to that, right? But it didn't give us all the account abstraction.

383
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:42.329
Łukasz Rozmej: Thing. So, just for this, I… for this particular problem, I would prefer this kind of solution. So the thing is, do we want to also solve, like, the general thing, which is…

384
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:51.829
Łukasz Rozmej: makes things really complex, maybe we do want, but makes it really complex, or do we just want that kind of thing, right? So that's the question for me.

385
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.659
Łukasz Rozmej: I mean, if you… Oh, this is what they have.

386
00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:58.040
Felix (Geth): Sorry, Dragon, I think you really want to say something, so I guess we can just…

387
00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.810
Felix (Geth): You can also take it away.

388
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:04.530
Felix (Geth): Is it related with this point, or your point from earlier, or…

389
00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:07.629
Dragan Rakita: Yeah, I think Lukashi is basically…

390
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:13.360
Dragan Rakita: saying what I want to say. If we have… You don't need to have…

391
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:21.559
Dragan Rakita: multiple transaction types for every signature. You can have one transaction that has signature type.

392
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.160
Dragan Rakita: And some generic field that depends on that signature type.

393
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:32.159
Dragan Rakita: So this is, like, a lot simpler solution than introducing the frame that's going to ask EVM what's going on.

394
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:36.480
Dragan Rakita: And that kind of abstraction seems, like, overginated.

395
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.850
lightclient: Yeah, I can respond quickly to these comments.

396
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:51.130
lightclient: I think the tempo-style transaction types are kind of nice, because they are fairly simplistic in that sense.

397
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.320
lightclient: But I don't think that it…

398
00:56:54.560 --> 00:57:01.049
lightclient: really solves the, like, long tail of things that we want to solve with frame transactions.

399
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:14.830
lightclient: yes, like, post-quantum is one of the most important things that Frame Transaction does, but there are other core goals that Frame Transactions is aiming to improve upon, and…

400
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:28.109
lightclient: the tempo-style transactions doesn't address the privacy issues that frame transaction can. So, concretely, today, if you want to withdraw from a privacy pool.

401
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:35.359
lightclient: You either need to have some EOA that exists with some Ether that you can submit your withdrawal transaction from.

402
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:50.300
lightclient: Which creates a chicken and egg problem, like, how do you get this Ether in this private way? If you could have done that, you probably wouldn't have used the privacy pool. Or, you have to use a centralized relayer, who then has some metadata on you about the privacy pool withdrawal.

403
00:57:50.810 --> 00:58:00.709
lightclient: With the frame transaction, we have the ability to actually change the validation logic, and we could do the withdrawal before the gas for the transaction is approved.

404
00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:05.449
lightclient: So these are things that just aren't possible with the tempo-style transactions.

405
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:21.580
lightclient: And I think that they are very important for Ethereum as a protocol, and they match our core tenets of having trustlessness, privacy, and, you know, generalizable abstractions, giving developers

406
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:34.889
lightclient: powerful tools to have permissionless innovation. And the prefix menu of crypto algorithms that has been proposed in a few different examples just doesn't give this flexibility.

407
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:57.510
Felix (Geth): So where do we stand with this now? Dano, I see you have your hand up. Do you want to respond to this directly, or raise a new point, or…

408
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.650
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: I want to talk about post-quantum signature sizes, so we can finish this discussion, and then that's that point.

409
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:14.910
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah. So this is more like… so I would say that, like, the title for this particular discussion item is just, like, what is the purpose of frame transactions anyways? We are still discussing on that basic point.

410
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:32.589
Felix (Geth): And Matt kind of answered it, and I can also answer it in my way. For me, I feel like introducing transaction types to the protocol in the first place was kind of awkward, and I wish that if we introduce new transaction types, they have to be valuable to us, and

411
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:40.300
Felix (Geth): just adding more transaction types for every little feature that we try to add. For example, now, we're gonna add a transaction type that

412
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:51.390
Felix (Geth): I don't know, if we were to add a transaction type now that just specifically supports a different kind of signature, or, like, a parameterizable signature, or whatever.

413
00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:58.220
Felix (Geth): That is just ultimately gonna lead to more pain and fractures of protocol, where we…

414
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:07.539
Felix (Geth): feel like with the frame transaction, we were able, for the first time, to actually clean up some tech depth regarding transaction types, and the…

415
01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:18.989
Felix (Geth): frame transaction fundamentally is a lot simpler than other transactions. It has the frames, yes, but the overall amount of features in it is much reduced, and we don't really see, like.

416
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:24.750
Felix (Geth): Too many extensions that are gonna be required in the future for this type.

417
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:30.030
Felix (Geth): Specifically because a lot can be done with, frames and…

418
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:38.220
Felix (Geth): It just solves a lot of problems that other transaction types tried to solve before in a more specialized way.

419
01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:55.389
Felix (Geth): Regarding the initial motivation, so the initial motivation for this is to add, post-quantum signatures quite soon, but we do want to combine it, and this is, like, going back to the point that Wukash raised in the beginning, it is very good for us

420
01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960
Felix (Geth): To combine this with

421
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:11.830
Felix (Geth): account abstraction, because we feel like it's also kind of an overdue feature, and the two go together really well with this transaction. So that's why we decided, indeed, to just put both of these things in the same proposal.

422
01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:28.860
Felix (Geth): And we feel like, just, they can both be solved in the same fundamental way, and that makes us believe that this is a stronger proposal than trying to only solve the very specific issue of verifying the transaction origin signature in a different way. Like, it goes beyond that, in a way.

423
01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:34.900
Felix (Geth): Anyway, so I see, Wukat, you have your hand up again.

424
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:57.600
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, so, I completely agree that how we did transaction types was wrong, because they are kind of resembling, object-oriented inheritance model, that one transaction kind of inherits from the other type, etc. And now, when we have multiple dimensions, we want to go with those transactions, they are… we kind of get stuck, so maybe…

425
01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.249
Łukasz Rozmej: we should try to compose transaction types, right? So, for example, if we were redesigning, we could have

426
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:21.990
Łukasz Rozmej: 1559 transactions, and compose that into blob transactions, and just adding blobs to it, right? Or something, and adding different signatures to it, etc. So maybe this is the way to go, in a way. So, those transactions will still have all the properties of the previous type, but we can just add new properties to it.

427
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:27.780
Łukasz Rozmej: And that kind of is… And this is.

428
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:36.009
Felix (Geth): I mean, I agree with this. Long time, it would be nice to have a more composable transaction type, but we feel like we kind of have that now with this

429
01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.900
Felix (Geth): Because the… if you look at the basic envelope of the frame transaction, it is…

430
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:45.259
Felix (Geth): Basically, a fresh start. And, we can…

431
01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:59.140
Felix (Geth): basically turn it into more things later. For example, the frames themselves are also extensible in some ways. We don't really plan to extend it too much now, but, like, if it becomes a necessity, we can also extend it.

432
01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:08.440
Felix (Geth): So… I don't know, I don't think… like, like I said, I think a lot of the components of transactions that were introduced, like, for example, the access list.

433
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:22.159
Felix (Geth): it solved a specific problem, which we now feel is, like, solvable in a different way, so we didn't include it. It's same for the delegations. We feel like the delegations, they solve a specific problem, and if delegations are still supposed to be relevant later.

434
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:30.079
Felix (Geth): for example, for the EOA migration purposes, then we have to find another way to do it that isn't related with the transaction type.

435
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:48.939
Felix (Geth): So, yeah, I mean, this combinatorial thing that Dustin is also mentioning, we kind of don't want that anymore. So, we feel like with frame transaction, we do have a shot at reducing complexity there, which is very important for us. And, I mean, again, you have to see it in the wider picture. We're trying to introduce account abstraction, we're trying to solve post-quantum, but we also feel like we…

436
01:03:49.320 --> 01:04:07.979
Felix (Geth): actually figured out a pretty nice encoding for transactions in general, so this… these are the views why we think this proposal is, like, pertinent now, especially compared to the other, more narrowly focused ones. So I think this answers now the question of, like, what we want to do with this in the first place, and I think we should move on to other questions.

437
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:20.209
Felix (Geth): Dano, you had… we have still… let me just summarize it quickly. Dano, you were saying something about the signature specifically. We can go there. This will be a kind of a focus thing, I guess.

438
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:31.570
Felix (Geth): We have still this comment about the dev tooling that we should address, and then now, Luis, you also have something? Do you have a comment that goes to the current discussion, or you want to bring a new point?

439
01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:51.230
Luis Pinto | Besu: Yeah, yeah, it's still… it's about the general, the architecture of the frame transaction in general. I'm not convinced, but it's just playing as a devil's advocate, on this, apart from introducing more EVM complexity around, like, the message frames and stuff.

440
01:04:51.420 --> 01:05:00.049
Luis Pinto | Besu: I wonder if there's not a security concern, like, more attack vectors in terms of…

441
01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:10.370
Luis Pinto | Besu: Because now we are basically building a framework for how users do signatures, or transaction signing.

442
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.769
Luis Pinto | Besu: We are…

443
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:31.350
Luis Pinto | Besu: delegating that all to a smart contract, if I'm correct, and so anyone can create their own way of signing, a custom way of signing. I wonder, in terms of safety, like, because now wallets can pick the exact signature, so it's not, like.

444
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:37.460
Luis Pinto | Besu: trusted by core devs that you should pick this signature or that one. It's kind of…

445
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:42.580
Luis Pinto | Besu: all open, and anyone can create their own thing.

446
01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:48.120
Luis Pinto | Besu: Yeah, I'm just raising this as a point. I'm not either convinced this is a problem, or…

447
01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.580
Luis Pinto | Besu: or concern, but just, I think it's worth raising it.

448
01:05:53.070 --> 01:06:05.189
Felix (Geth): Okay, I can very quickly address this. So, the way we see it is that, in some ways, I also felt the same way in the beginning, that it's a bit scary to introduce a primitive in the protocol that basically allows

449
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:20.370
Felix (Geth): full control over the signatures, but what you have to realize is that, in practice, a lot of Ethereum contracts have such logic, and we do trust them also. So it's not always just about the signature verification, there is…

450
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.700
Felix (Geth): Like, there… there are…

451
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:41.310
Felix (Geth): many places in the protocol where users now are subjected to a validation that is fully defined by the contract, and the only thing we're really changing here is that the transaction origin can be validated in a different way. And, I mean, it…

452
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:58.170
Felix (Geth): it's maybe along the same lines that you can see, like, would you personally trust putting your money into a specific wallet implementation? You always have to make that choice. There are conservative wallets, and there will be very simple ways to deploy accounts that

453
01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:04.430
Felix (Geth): Don't have any of the advanced features, but literally just do the signature verification and that's it.

454
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:14.830
Felix (Geth): And they will be secure. I mean, we expect, at least I personally, I have to speak for myself here, I know that some of the authors on the frame transaction proposal don't think like this.

455
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:29.069
Felix (Geth): But for me, especially, I still think that, like, a good chunk of the signature verification is going to be handled by precompiles, simply because precompiles are easy to scale in terms of the compute, and they can also be incentivized. So…

456
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:39.750
Felix (Geth): It is something where… I feel very strongly that precompiles are there forever.

457
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:59.329
Felix (Geth): unlike some other people who see it as more like everything should be implemented in EVM opcodes, and the EVM should be fast enough to do this, both views, I think, are valid, but in terms of the safety, for example, of the cryptographic implementations, obviously, if you have a very simple contract that just forwards the call data in the verify frame directly into a precompile.

458
01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:06.209
Felix (Geth): and just reports whether the verification was successful, then that is very safe and

459
01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:10.740
Felix (Geth): We expect that most users will use a scheme like this.

460
01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:25.479
Felix (Geth): instead of their account the way they have it now. But they can have the benefit then of, for example, migrating to a different encryption scheme later, and so on, because they might… they may be able to, for example, upgrade the verification that is deployed to their account.

461
01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:32.520
Felix (Geth): Which is something that they cannot do now. If you create an account now by creating a public key, you cannot get off of that key.

462
01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.929
Felix (Geth): Whereas in the new scheme, you can. And so we see that as a… actually, it's a…

463
01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.030
Felix (Geth): It's a plus for the security.

464
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.050
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I hope that was helpful,

465
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:53.319
Felix (Geth): If not, we can discuss it further.

466
01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:04.269
Felix (Geth): Luis, do you wanna… do you have a follow-up question, or is it… does it help you in your understanding, or…

467
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.590
Felix (Geth): No, no, that's… those are reasonable arguments, yes.

468
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:17.389
Luis Pinto | Besu: Yeah, well, you can look it either way, like, future upgrades as well make it easier, and don't need a hard fork and client consensus.

469
01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.080
Luis Pinto | Besu: That's a good point.

470
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.290
Felix (Geth): Okay.

471
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.160
Felix (Geth): Very cool, so I think we resolved…

472
01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:27.229
Felix (Geth): We still have Dano, and we have the DevTooling thing. I think, Dano, yours is gonna be…

473
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:31.990
Felix (Geth): Very specific, so let's just go with that one now. You've had your hand up for a long time also.

474
01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:48.089
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Yeah, I'm concerned that there hasn't been enough thought, but it's the size of these signatures. Both quantum signatures, or generally speaking, going to be much larger. Best case scenario, half a kilobyte. More realistically, multiple kilobytes, and there's been illusion that we might need to do hashing signatures.

475
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:58.709
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: And those are closer to 10 kilobytes per signature. So there's been talk from, on some EFers on Twitter that this is going to have to go towards signature aggregation.

476
01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.760
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Which means we're gonna have to take the signature out of the transaction.

477
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:09.899
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So my comment on the current design is that putting the signature in the middle of the frame transaction means we're going to have to rewrite it, which is going to be very error-prone.

478
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:23.059
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: The signature itself should be separated from the transaction body. It should be put in some other place that we can drop it. So either a separate table that follows afterwards, or the frame would reference a row in that table, or you're not going to like this.

479
01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:34.760
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: SSV is custom-built for this, to take one specific field, drop it out, and reference it by hash. So you take that signature, reference it by hash, and then you can have the,

480
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:40.290
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: ZK proof for whatever aggregation you have, for those signatures, and you don't have to share that.

481
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:47.459
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: So, blobs are not big enough for the signatures. These signatures, we're gonna hit giga gas just by data carriage alone.

482
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.090
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: That's how big these are.

483
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:57.889
Felix (Geth): Okay, I can quickly go… I know, Matt, you also have your hand up, but I can also just very quickly, address a little bit of this. So,

484
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:17.500
Felix (Geth): We are aware of these signature sizes, and there has been stuff proposed. I just want to fundamentally state that I am not opposed to, for example, using SSC for the encoding. We are not married to the actual encoding of this, like, if SSC is the way to do it, and it gives us the benefit, I'm happy to do it. We just specced it the way we did it, because it's easier for us, we understand it better.

485
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.600
Felix (Geth): It was simpler to prototype.

486
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:26.960
Felix (Geth): There is no, we are not fundamentally attached to the ROP encoding of these transactions the way they are now.

487
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:30.279
Felix (Geth): So, that is still something we can fully debate.

488
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:39.320
Felix (Geth): That said, with the rewrites of the transaction, we have put, some effort into…

489
01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:54.770
Felix (Geth): ensuring that, specifically, the verified frames of the transaction can… like, first of all, they are malleable, because they are not covered by the signature hash. Or, I mean, that's not true. The frame structure of the transaction is covered by the signature hash.

490
01:11:54.770 --> 01:12:05.100
Felix (Geth): But the data content of the verify frames is not covered by the signature hash, because it is supposed to contain the signature. So this part can be alighted when it goes into the block.

491
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:13.240
Felix (Geth): And then what this will mean is that it is possible to publish a proof of the verification of these signatures at the end of the block.

492
01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:26.239
Felix (Geth): Without losing too much information. And yes, it could be replaced by the hash of it for the sake of hashing the transaction and things like that. We are happy to, to work on these, on these things.

493
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:36.600
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Rewriting should be unnecessary. If you… rewriting should be unnecessary. If you structure the transaction right, you never have to rewrite sections of it when you change a signature.

494
01:12:37.450 --> 01:13:01.159
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, you don't have to… that's what I'm trying to say. I think what we are mostly talking about is just, like, there are different phases of the transaction, so one phase that we recognize is that when the transaction goes into a block, obviously we have an aggregation possibility, whereas when the user submits a transaction to the network, the transaction has to be somehow attached to the signature. And yeah, I mean, I understand it. We can structure it in a way that basically makes the… puts the…

495
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.520
Felix (Geth): Data at the end, or whatever, but it…

496
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.019
Felix (Geth): Doesn't really make too much of a difference, like.

497
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.829
Felix (Geth): for us right now. Anyway, this point, we will…

498
01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:20.529
Felix (Geth): work on that, and I'm also happy to discuss it further with you offline, what is the perfect encoding for this, but we are aware of this. I just want to quickly give an alternative solution that was also proposed. There is,

499
01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:26.079
Felix (Geth): a proposal from Vitalik for the future to, introduce an

500
01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.920
Felix (Geth): operation in the EVM that basically gives you…

501
01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:39.949
Felix (Geth): So, that would operate like a block-wide signature stack, so basically then what it would do is you'd

502
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:46.570
Felix (Geth): The block builder would come up with something that's a bit similar to, let's say, a block access list.

503
01:13:46.960 --> 01:14:04.799
Felix (Geth): And, then the… each transaction would kind of basically index into that access list somehow, and just… you would… the transactions would… could be aggregated on… on that level. We are still in discussions, like, how to best present this option, but it is also something that has been discussed.

504
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:17.399
Felix (Geth): Anyway, I just want to mention that, yes, these concerns are very valid, and we are fully aware that introducing post-quantum signatures has a size issue, and it has to be addressed by the proposal. So, yeah.

505
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:26.680
Felix (Geth): That said, we did… we chose not to include this in this specific proposal, because we wanted it to be more about the generic,

506
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:32.909
Felix (Geth): Structure, and we'll see how this all…

507
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:37.229
Felix (Geth): Comes together, but definitely it is an important consideration.

508
01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:47.960
lightclient: I just wanted to add two quick comments on, first, the rewriting aspect of the transaction. I don't really think that there is rewriting that needs to be done.

509
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:53.710
lightclient: You know, for the most part, like, the transaction as it's sent over the wire is how it looks at the block.

510
01:14:53.870 --> 01:15:07.200
lightclient: the main two things that can be done is, you know, one is in the EIP, which is alighting the data in the frame transaction, so you can't introspect what the signature is from other transactions. This is what gives us the future ability to…

511
01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.530
lightclient: Do some kind of signature aggregation there.

512
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:29.930
lightclient: We're open to different serialization schemes for this information. I don't think that that's particularly… that's, like, a particular sticking point for us. But the data is arbitrary, so we can choose to have some magic 4-byte field at the front of it, to denote that this is aggregatable format, whatever. So…

513
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:39.099
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: If you're aggregating it, it's not how it goes over the wire, then. You're gonna… it's gonna have a different representation if you're taking a signature and not shipping the signature in the canonical block.

514
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.129
lightclient: Okay, I see, yeah, so you would remove it from the frame.

515
01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.880
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: Otherwise, what's the point of aggregation if we're.

516
01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.510
lightclient: No, no, sorry, you'.

517
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:50.969
Danno Ferrin - Tectonic.xyz: you know, gigabyte blocks.

518
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:58.609
lightclient: Yeah, okay, sorry. You're right about this? We do… we would need to rewrite it in that case.

519
01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:04.939
lightclient: But this is how we are already representing it, as the,

520
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:09.219
lightclient: This is the serialization scheme that we already represented in.

521
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.490
lightclient: So I think that it's not a major issue.

522
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:15.579
lightclient: And it's done by the block builder already.

523
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:23.629
lightclient: So, it's okay. We do this for blob transactions. The blob looks slightly different over the wire. We don't include the blob in the block.

524
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.720
lightclient: I think these are okay.

525
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:28.860
lightclient: the broader points I wanted to make about

526
01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.140
lightclient: Why do this now, even if the signatures are large?

527
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:38.169
lightclient: Is… it's going to take a very long time for people to migrate to post-quantum crypto.

528
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:39.300
lightclient: And…

529
01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:57.140
lightclient: Today, maybe the signature schemes are large, maybe the people who need post-quantum crypto are a smaller group. That's going to grow over time. It's going to take time for tooling to support it, it's going to take time for wallets to support it, it's going to take time for users to decide that they're ready to migrate to that. And the sooner that we can make this start.

530
01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:04.249
lightclient: The better place we're gonna be in in 3 years, 5 years, you know, at whatever time period that we…

531
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:12.730
lightclient: realize that everybody needs to start migrating. I don't think that there is a good, feasible path to doing an all-at-once migration for users.

532
01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:26.599
lightclient: Is this something that's kind of been talked in the past? You know, one day maybe the quantum canary goes off, and it's time to migrate all the accounts. I don't think there is a good mechanism to migrate all theory into concept plus quantum, so we need to start early, and we need to start educating people that they should look into this.

533
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:55.089
Felix (Geth): Yeah, notably, the proposal does not define a migration path. It gives people the option to create accounts which are not linked to an ECDSA key, but it does not give people the means to fully unlink their account from the ECDSA key.

534
01:17:55.090 --> 01:18:04.719
Felix (Geth): We do see that as a separate step, but it could be as simple as an operation that installs a delegation and then gives you, like, throws away the key, basically.

535
01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:16.420
Felix (Geth): So there is, like, you could somehow permanently delegate your account to some code, and not make it possible to create further delegations. These kinds of mechanisms have to be specified in a different EAB.

536
01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:30.560
Felix (Geth): But we feel like once the way is there for people to actually create accounts that are not linked to any key, it is possible for us to introduce these kinds of mechanisms, but introducing them before is not possible.

537
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:48.129
Felix (Geth): Right, so we still want to discuss a bit about the dev tooling. Dragon, you had some comments, it seemed like you were reporting these comments from another discussion.

538
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:53.790
Felix (Geth): I'm less sure where they are coming from.

539
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:58.330
Dragan Rakita: Well, I'm still not convinced that we should do framed intersection.

540
01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:04.780
Dragan Rakita: I know that we started this, like, discussion as, do you have questions about framed resection, but…

541
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:12.230
Dragan Rakita: I could, like, switch up that to basically ask why do we even want framed section.

542
01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:18.469
Dragan Rakita: Because I'm not convinced that this is, like, solution that you want to include in Ethereum.

543
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:27.699
Dragan Rakita: So, maybe I'm just… I'm talking just in my, like, in my view, so…

544
01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:30.109
Dragan Rakita: There are a lot of clients, a lot of developers.

545
01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.480
Dragan Rakita: So, yeah.

546
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:50.249
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, I understand that it's a lot, like, that's the thing, this proposal is kind of a lot, I understand that. I also, when I first saw this, I had kind of a similar reaction. I mean, I got introduced to this proposal idea by way of talking to Vitalik, and he basically presented,

547
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:53.550
Felix (Geth): Version of this, to me, and…

548
01:19:53.730 --> 01:20:06.720
Felix (Geth): I was thinking, like, oh my god, this is nuts, like, we should never do this. But then at… over… over time, I actually really warmed up to it, and I think it does solve the problem in a very fundamental way. So, just want to highlight that.

549
01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.610
Felix (Geth): it…

550
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:25.210
Felix (Geth): it's a very… it tries to address this issue at a very, very fundamental level. It goes a bit beyond just saying, yeah, we should add a new signature type on the transaction. It's not as simple as that, because it's kind of this combo solution that, like, solves a bunch of different issues of Ethereum at the same time.

551
01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:38.610
Felix (Geth): I can fully understand that it can seem a bit overwhelming at first, so that's also why I wanted to have this discussion, to really address all these points, like, that people have, like, what's it gonna do to this? What's it gonna do to that? Like, what are the… why is it so…

552
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:42.080
Felix (Geth): Yeah, but… Why is this so weird?

553
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:46.339
Dragan Rakita: I think that's the main problem that I have with this.

554
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:51.560
Dragan Rakita: Is the main point for the frame intersection to, like, introduce new signature types?

555
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:58.939
Dragan Rakita: we have a simple solution that we should use. There's not a lot of signatures out there, and there is not a.

556
01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:02.569
lightclient: It's not just to do one thing, though, like, we kind of said this…

557
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:09.329
lightclient: You know, it has a primary purpose, but there is a long tail of

558
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:23.149
lightclient: things that the frame transaction finally solves once and for all, and none of the other proposals address those. I don't think that we should do these, like, keyhole solutions for every single problem. We should come up with a general framework that's powerful.

559
01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:32.639
Dragan Rakita: Now, my sub-question to that, what are… what are those additional problems that you want to solve with this generic solution?

560
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:38.999
lightclient: Yeah, so I mentioned one concrete one in the chat, but there's an issue with privacy protocols.

561
01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:42.510
lightclient: So… privacy protocols.

562
01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:57.960
lightclient: don't really have a good way around the fact that an EOA today needs to submit a transaction to withdraw the ETH. So that means either you need to somehow get anonymous ETH to withdraw, or you need to go through a centralized provider. So it adds better privacy for your users.

563
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:05.730
lightclient: It adds better trustlessness, because you don't have to rely on a centralized party. There's also the point that Frederick brought up, which is transaction assertions.

564
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:11.459
lightclient: So, frame transactions allow you to have multiple frames, and you can have more complicated

565
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:21.279
lightclient: validation logic around whether a transaction should be included or not. So you could actually add, at the end of the transaction, the approval frame to

566
01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:26.849
lightclient: Pay for the gas and approve the overall transaction, only if certain assertions were met.

567
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:38.859
lightclient: So, again, like, this is just the stuff that we've, like, kind of come up with. There's a handful of other things. There will be more things that people come up with that we can't even imagine right now. That's the benefit of permissionless innovation.

568
01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:50.740
Dragan Rakita: That's what I'm saying. Basically, what are the use cases that you want this generic solution to enable? If there is, like, 2, or maybe 3, or maybe 5,

569
01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:55.090
Dragan Rakita: It doesn't need… you don't need a general framework for those.

570
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.370
lightclient: I mean, that's just what we disagree on.

571
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.110
Dragan Rakita: That's true.

572
01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:05.500
lightclient: I mean, I think this is what Ethereum was built on, is providing generalized frameworks for people to innovate.

573
01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:12.550
lightclient: And I don't agree that we should come up with a prefix menu of solutions for users.

574
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:21.950
Felix (Geth): There's also an argument from Vitalik, that I found personally very, very good. So,

575
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:41.010
Felix (Geth): there is always the question of, like, what should be the special cases in the protocol? And right now, we've kind of gotten in the habit of special casing everything, whereas this proposal is… it doesn't really have… like, there are no special cases, but you can do the use cases with it, and you can also do the future use cases with it.

576
01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:53.259
Felix (Geth): Like, privacy protocols is kind of a big thing that's never really been possible before. Maybe a couple issues, like, couple, like, smaller-scale proposals have existed, but they would always come at the cost of creating

577
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:59.509
Felix (Geth): Yeah, like a special case in the protocol just for this one thing, and we wouldn't really be able to…

578
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:17.230
Felix (Geth): figure it out, like, in another way. And then now, for example, we're considering this problem of, adding signature flexibility on the transactions. Yeah, I mean, there's a specialized proposal for that, where we're creating a special case where, like, how do you sign this specific thing? But then again, it's like…

579
01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:25.510
Felix (Geth): We're gonna come up with even more things, like, it's just gonna multiply the amount of special cases we have in the protocol, whereas with this thing, we have to…

580
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:33.390
Felix (Geth): the… the possibility of removing special cases, and we're really happy about that. So that's kind of where we're coming from with this.

581
01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:39.040
Felix (Geth): I know, Anska, you wanted to probably remind us of the time, or I don't know…

582
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:59.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I mean, I was… I just want to just briefly interject, like, I think I initially wanted to have a bit more time, in case we still wanted to make a decision. It seems clear to me now that we are just not going to make a decision today, so then, in terms of, like, next steps, then it will be very simple, so then, yeah, if we want to have 2-3 more minutes to wrap up, then that's fine.

583
01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:19.069
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I was kind of curious about this DevTooling comment. I still kind of wanted to get to that thing, like, you posted that initially, and I wanted to just highlight some things from that. I mean, I started by quoting this, and then we went into a whole other discussion, so if we just quickly go back to this… to this point. So, you wrote earlier that

584
01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:31.690
Felix (Geth): I think this comment kind of also highlights maybe some of the misconception about this. So you're saying that, like, developers don't want to worry about defining the frames, so we don't really see it like that.

585
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.870
Felix (Geth): The fundamental thing that people will do is just…

586
01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.780
Felix (Geth): The… or the fundamental thing that is…

587
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:53.789
Felix (Geth): how these transactions work is that you have to come up with your contract invocation payload the same way you have to come up with your contract invocation now. It is just more like a different way of encoding your signature.

588
01:25:54.470 --> 01:26:01.880
Felix (Geth): and possibly your fee-paying logic into the transaction. So all of these, like, the way this…

589
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:15.729
Felix (Geth): thing works is maybe more like a… you can think of it as more like a data format for the transaction. And it's different from the previous data formats of transactions, because it does things in this, like, dynamic list type of way, but…

590
01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.119
Felix (Geth): It is fundamentally just a different way to put your transaction in… to put your signature in.

591
01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:28.450
Felix (Geth): You can have more advanced use cases with the frames, but these use cases are for special…

592
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:37.330
Felix (Geth): occasions. For example, you can do the native bundling with this. If bundling is a necessity for some use cases, you can

593
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:48.170
Felix (Geth): use it for that. Or you can have things like, conditions on your… on the transaction inclusion. These are also possible with this proposal, and you can encode them as frames.

594
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.419
Felix (Geth): It gives you some advantages to do it like that.

595
01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:07.679
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I don't know. I don't think that fundamentally, like, the dev tooling has to change very much. It has to learn how to encode the transaction, but this is something that every transaction type so far has required.

596
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:16.419
Felix (Geth): So, there have always been updates to all the tooling for each new transaction type, because we expect people to submit their transaction in the…

597
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:30.210
Felix (Geth): binary format now, which means that, yeah, the libraries have to accommodate for the new type, so it's no different with this one. But we also do not expect libraries to give users, like.

598
01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:32.660
Felix (Geth): complete

599
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:50.000
Felix (Geth): access to, like, structuring their transactions. It is in practice, or maybe they can, but it's not expected that users will have to think too much about the frame structure of their transactions. Most transactions are gonna be really simple. They're gonna have a verify frame that defines the signature, they're maybe gonna have a frame that

600
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.399
Felix (Geth): Delegates the gas payment, and then they're gonna have the main execute frame that just…

601
01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:15.460
Felix (Geth): puts the payload to the contract. And we expect that for most people, this is gonna be how this is used. And then for the certain special use cases, for example, withdrawal from privacy protocols or other things, you may have additional frames or a slightly different structure, but it's more like an advanced thing.

602
01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.059
Felix (Geth): So that's how we see it.

603
01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:36.400
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, then this is a good stopping point for now. As I said just now, I think it seemed clear that we won't be in a position to make a decision today, just because I think we both have the rest team still maybe not convinced in general about prime transactions, and then we also had

604
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:45.590
Ansgar Dietrichs: For example, the Bezu team saying that they don't feel comfortable with committing today, but before having discussed more with the team.

605
01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:56.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: It does seem like, even after this discussion, there's still open discussion points, and maybe instead of just making it very specific about frames, it does seem like there's maybe some discussion

606
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:10.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: need about, like, the general future approach to transaction, transaction generalization? Do we even want to do some general purpose account abstraction? Should… could we get away with more special purpose, just kind of, like, some, some more transaction?

607
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:18.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: extensions, it feels sensible to still schedule a breakout call, to just basically talk about

608
01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:23.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: You know, the future of transactions, and isFrameTransactions what we want to do, and want to do now?

609
01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: If that's… does that… does that seem sensible for the Prime Transaction Champions?

610
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:33.120
lightclient: Sounds good.

611
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:52.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then I think we'll, async figure out an exact date and announce that for people to join. I also initially had the hope to maybe just, like, already reduce the number of headliner proposals, but I feel like it's just… there's not necessarily a point in it right now. Also, there was still enough residual support for Lucid that I don't want to just…

612
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.719
Ansgar Dietrichs: push this through now if there's no specific reason for it, so then I would say.

613
01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:16.439
Ansgar Dietrichs: for the Lucid Champions, you know, the next two weeks would be your chance to basically make a difference in moving the… in convincing people that this should happen now. It seems like a lot of people in general like the idea, but most people feel like it's just premature and not necessarily maybe robust enough yet. Yeah, you have two weeks to…

614
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:20.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

615
01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:24.830
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sure, unless… Yep.

616
01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:30.099
lightclient: Guys, Lucid's not going in the protocol for Hagota. Like, we can just make this decision right now.

617
01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:39.759
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sure, I mean, we can also, yes, we can also reject the Lucid and SEC headliner proposals today, if people prefer.

618
01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:46.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: Just not sure we'll have… Client consensus on this?

619
01:30:52.190 --> 01:30:56.180
lightclient: I mean, only one client proposed Lucid as their headliner. That seems…

620
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:59.809
lightclient: Sufficient on its face to make a decision.

621
01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:08.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think we had Erigon saying that if not Frame, they would strongly prefer doing something other than nothing, so they would basically prefer Lucid over nothing.

622
01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.240
lightclient: But still 2 clients versus 3 clients.

623
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:17.070
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, this is just why, you know, it doesn't seem like consensus.

624
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.880
lightclient: I think we should whittle away at our options.

625
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:28.470
lightclient: I feel extremely strongly about not doing Lucid. I think a lot of the guest team feels very strongly about this.

626
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:32.890
lightclient: I think other client teams also feel somewhat strongly about not doing Lucid.

627
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:38.200
lightclient: Like, we're just going to waste time if we continue talking about this.

628
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:54.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. Yeah, that's why I initially wanted to timebox the frame transaction discussion more, to have more time for this, but, sure, then…

629
01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:59.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: from the Besu and Erigon team's side, I… they…

630
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:10.589
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do… are these… are both of those teams open to rejecting Lucid for Edgestar today, or would you basically prefer to veto that decision and leave it up for two weeks from now?

631
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:19.229
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): I would prefer if we wait for two weeks. I don't think we waste a lot of time if we have one breakout car.

632
01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.470
lightclient: Erigon?

633
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:34.430
andrew (erigon): Yes, so we'd also like to keep Lucid as an option as well.

634
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:45.279
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, then, Matt, I think, we will stick with keeping it for now. I think the understanding is very clearly that

635
01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: Unless people…

636
01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:59.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: change their minds strongly, which of course could happen, but I think otherwise it will be more a backup candidate to discuss in case we end up deciding against prime transactions. I don't think it'll take up much room by default.

637
01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.400
lightclient: What if I'm willing to die on the hill of not including Lucid transactions?

638
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:07.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then, 2 weeks from now would be your time to die.

639
01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:11.059
Ansgar Dietrichs: Or to specifically, like, block Lucid.

640
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:16.590
nixo: Matt, you also have a conflict of interest here, I think that… It's…

641
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:20.800
nixo: It's good to… to keep considering it.

642
01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:28.870
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I have to agree. Unfortunately, I think, I mean, as much as you can be against it, we have to give it a fair chance.

643
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:35.830
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so no dying on hills today, then. So, yes.

644
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:40.339
Ansgar Dietrichs: We will not formally reject headliners today.

645
01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:44.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: But the understanding is clear that in two weeks, we will make a decision.

646
01:33:45.130 --> 01:34:00.029
Ansgar Dietrichs: And the clear two main frontrunners are, frame transactions or doing nothing, and we will have a breakout to specifically discuss frame transactions. If the Lucid people want to organize a breakout as well or something, that's of course possible. Just reach out to us.

647
01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:07.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. That's all for now, then. Thank you all very much, and talk to you in two weeks.

648
01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:11.090
Potuz: Bye.

649
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:14.460
andrew (erigon): Thank you, bye-bye.

650
01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:21.460
lightclient: See ya.

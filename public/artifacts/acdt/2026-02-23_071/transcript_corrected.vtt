00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.240
Mario Vega: Hello.

2
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.869
Akash | ECH: Hey, hello, hello. Hey, Mario, I'm helping with the stream today, so let me know whenever you're ready.

3
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.909
Mario Vega: Sounds good. Thank you.

4
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.510
Akash | ECH: Yep, welcome.

5
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.360
saulius: Hello.

6
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:13.749
Mario Vega: Hi everyone, we'll just give one more minute, to get time out to everyone to join, and we can start.

7
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.580
Mario Vega: Alright, I think we can start.

8
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.400
Akash | ECH: Real life.

9
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:40.829
Mario Vega: Thank you. Welcome, everybody, to ACDT number 71. Today's February 23rd, 2026.

10
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:55.209
Mario Vega: Yeah, we have a couple things in the agenda. Fusaka, Glamsterdam, state float. I think the main discussion point's gonna be focus on dignitary readiness, but before we go there, yeah, let's start with Fusaka.

11
00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:06.260
Mario Vega: Okay, so the first item in the agenda is the Blob DevNet Zero update. I think, Barnabas, for this, you're the best person with contacts here. Would you mind to give us an update?

12
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:15.100
Barnabas: Yeah, so Blob.net Zero is testing the partial cell request, and last week we had a bit of

13
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.600
Barnabas: trouble. Some peers got disconnected. I haven't had

14
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:32.030
Barnabas: much time to, investigate what the actual reason for all the disconnects were. Restarting clients, just brought them back online, so it's probably not something critical.

15
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:39.959
Barnabas: I would assume that we just don't have enough, peers on the network to feed all the call-ins that we need, even though,

16
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:50.530
Barnabas: We have half of the nodes and super nodes, but yeah, I will dig into it a bit more. Right now, we are finalizing it, and we are near, 80%.

17
00:15:52.390 --> 00:16:10.210
Barnabas: But, yeah, we currently also only have Lighthouse and, Prysm, so it would be very good if we could start onboarding some other clients as well. Hopefully, someone from the CR teams can give us an update on how is that coming along.

18
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.980
Mario Vega: So, which teams do you have now, and which ones do you need?

19
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:26.550
Barnabas: We have Lighthouse, Prysm, and we are looking to, also include Teku, Nimbus, and, Grandine, and,

20
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.009
Barnabas: Just every LD, basically.

21
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.740
Mario Vega: And just for context, for Dustin, this is for Plot DevNet0.

22
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.879
Barnabas: This is for the partial cell stuff.

23
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:40.900
Barnabas: Dustin.

24
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:58.400
Matthew Keil: And you forgot Lodestar, and I still love you, Carnivas, just saying. We did get, implementations going, and we're getting a lot closer. We're hopeful to be there, for this week's, call on Thursday.

25
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.759
Mario Vega: Thank you. Anybody else?

26
00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:11.149
Mario Vega: On the rest of the CL teams.

27
00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:20.309
Mario Vega: Again, for context, this is blob.0.

28
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:28.139
saulius: Yeah, so for Grandine, we are still working on that, so maybe next week or so.

29
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.160
Mario Vega: Okay, thanks. From Teku, is there anyone?

30
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.060
Mario Vega: Who wants to chime in?

31
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.509
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, so for Teku, we are still working on implementation.

32
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.750
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, I have spoke to Lucas about it, so…

33
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.959
Stefan Bratanov: Hope you'll have a better day.

34
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:07.390
Mario Vega: Sounds good. Thank you. Barnabas, I wanted to ask, so this is, partial cells also covered, right?

35
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.750
Mario Vega: the subject.

36
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.940
Barnabas: Yes.

37
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.929
Mario Vega: Forget Blobbit P3, is this something different?

38
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.809
Barnabas: No, that's the same. One is on the ER side, one is on the CR side.

39
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.440
Mario Vega: Do you need horses?

40
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:31.829
Barnabas: We need support from each of the ELs to support the partial styles, but everybody has that already implemented in their trunk branches, so that's all good.

41
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.800
Mario Vega: Excellent.

42
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.880
Mario Vega: Alright.

43
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.660
Mario Vega: Good. Anything else from that topic, then? I don't think so, right?

44
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:58.079
Mario Vega: then we can move on. Yeah, let's go into Glamsterdam. For block-level access list definite 2, I think everything's been going smoothly, but is there any events or anything that can be brought up?

45
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.280
Mario Vega: Again, this is for block-level access list 72.

46
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.510
Mario Vega: Any findings?

47
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:22.750
Barnabas: So the network is, fairly stable. We're looking to, get an update on DevNet 3 readiness.

48
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.799
Mario Vega: Alright, yeah, let's just jump into that.

49
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:48.280
Mario Vega: Yeah, alright, since there are no updates on DevNet 2, let's go to Devon 3. I think the main discussion point here is gonna come from, actually, the testing team. Basically, what I've, gathered so far is that, we are planning on adding EIP 8037,

50
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:57.509
Mario Vega: into .NET3, but it's… it's proving to be quite the feat, to… to get this, the tests working.

51
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:04.269
Mario Vega: So yeah, for that, I think, Spencer, you have the best, context on this. Would you like to chime in?

52
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.170
Spencer: Hey, yeah, sounds good. So…

53
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:17.199
Spencer: I guess just to give a high-level context, so… 1837 adds…

54
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:24.080
Spencer: Something called the cost per state byte, which is dependent on the block,

55
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.390
Spencer: Add the block gas limit?

56
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:35.560
Spencer: And this, for the testing framework, adds an extra kind of dimension that we haven't yet Added before, so…

57
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:42.090
Spencer: It's adding this, like, at a very high level, and it's… it's been quite tricky to…

58
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:48.540
Spencer: Update the framework to… to align with this. So… And…

59
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:57.390
Spencer: how the framework works right now, for more context, you can kind of think of it as being split into three different sections, so there's the normal tests.

60
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.409
Spencer: The static tests, which are, like.

61
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:11.739
Spencer: the old Ethereum tests, YAML files, that we refill, so it's another way that we fill. And then also the benchmark tests.

62
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:17.510
Spencer: So we have, kind of, these three different sections that… All interplay together,

63
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.899
Spencer: But yeah, so the… I guess the tricky part overall is that, yeah, the…

64
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.020
Spencer: We have gas costs in tests that are now dependent on the block gas limit.

65
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:32.929
Spencer: And, yeah, I think there's just a lot of files that need to be changed,

66
00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:40.029
Spencer: We spoke about this briefly on Friday during the gas repricings call.

67
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.940
Spencer: One of the options as an alternative would be to…

68
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.610
Spencer: change the cost per state byte to a fork constant, and to be honest, yeah, I don't think it's…

69
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.370
Spencer: a good idea. I think Marius made a comment on the,

70
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:05.249
Spencer: the PM, agenda, kind of, kind of stating that it would defeat the purpose of 8037, which is true, and…

71
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.039
Spencer: I think, looking forward in the future, I… yeah, like, I…

72
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.860
Spencer: Our framework should support gas costs changing dependent on the block, the block.

73
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:20.820
Spencer: A gas limit, so… I have been working on some solutions on the framework to get this working.

74
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:29.000
Spencer: Over the weekend, but, yeah, I still need to work on it, and get that across the finish line, but…

75
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.859
Spencer: I think Marius also, suggested here to…

76
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.089
Spencer: Postpone 1837 to 11 at 4.

77
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.109
Spencer: Which I wouldn't be opposed to, because it would give us more time to,

78
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.980
Spencer: Get this working. And yeah, this so far has only been updating the framework, not writing the tests, so…

79
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.120
Spencer: Yeah, and for DevNet 3, I assume, like, the priority is…

80
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:58.430
Spencer: bowel optimizations, and please, please correct me if I'm wrong.

81
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.279
Spencer: But yeah, that's, I guess the main… the main update, from our side.

82
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.140
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you. Marius, would you…

83
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:20.309
Marius van der Wijden: Yes. Spencer, do you have, like, a sense of how long this would take you to implement all of this and write tests for 8037?

84
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:34.829
Spencer: So, to be honest, I would like to go all out on this until ACDE, and then maybe we can make a decision on ACDE about pushing it to DevNet 4 if the progress is slow.

85
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.710
Marius van der Wijden: Yep, I think that's a… that's a great compromise.

86
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.699
Mario Vega: The dragon?

87
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:50.519
Dragan Rakita: Could we hard-code it for the DevNet 3, and then implement the proper version for DevNet 4?

88
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.999
Mario Vega: What do you mean, hard-coded?

89
00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:00.060
Dragan Rakita: Hark, I think the problem is… The…

90
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.949
Dragan Rakita: Dynamic gas for the state, it depends on the block gas limit.

91
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:14.119
Dragan Rakita: That part feels like… At least this is my, like, take from what Spencer said.

92
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:27.750
Dragan Rakita: If this is the problem, then we can hardcore that number and just do proper version on the next DevNet 4. For DevNet 3, we will still have, like, something related to AP8037.

93
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.560
Spencer: Works for me, but if, others…

94
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.140
Spencer: are less, less keen. Please speak up.

95
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:53.149
Marius van der Wijden: It… it would also work for me. I… I would prefer not… like, I would prefer to use the formula, but, we can also just put the definite hot code it.

96
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.700
Marius van der Wijden: I just won… I just…

97
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.529
Marius van der Wijden: No matter which way we do it.

98
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.229
Marius van der Wijden: I just would like to have…

99
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.300
Marius van der Wijden: tests for it before we launch the DevNet.

100
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:17.969
Marius van der Wijden: And, I don't know if this… if hard-coding it will make the tests appear… be much faster.

101
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:25.709
Dragan Rakita: Why I'm proposing this? Because the 8037 is very sensitive.

102
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.360
Dragan Rakita: And it related to gas is very sensitive, so there is a lot of edge cases here.

103
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.219
Dragan Rakita: So, in my take is, let's do as…

104
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:43.269
Dragan Rakita: As best as possible, let's do… have something that we can reuse later, and have, like, more time to implement it, to test it later.

105
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.219
Dragan Rakita: So, if we start now, We will have, like, a bigger time frame to test everything.

106
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.949
Mario Vega: It is Maria.

107
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:12.430
Maria Silva: Yeah, so I think my understanding is also, like, there's, different components to AT37 that may actually make sense to test them separately. So we do have the multidimensional metering component, which is already introducing some logic that

108
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.370
Maria Silva: we need to think about tests, edge cases, and so on. So we…

109
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:27.399
Maria Silva: could make sense in DevNet 3 to focus that part of the EIP, and then do the cost… dynamic cost per byte component, in DevNet 4.

110
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.789
Maria Silva: So yeah, I'm essentially agreeing with… with Trevor.

111
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:45.100
Mario Vega: My question for Spencer would be, do you think going first with a constant and then dynamically? It feels to me that that's gonna be…

112
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.329
Mario Vega: refactoring that's gonna be necessary for next DevNet, so perhaps it could be even worse?

113
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.560
Mario Vega: I don't know, I haven't seen the code myself, but what do you think?

114
00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:04.799
Spencer: So it makes the framework changes a lot easier, which means there's, like, more time to spend on writing the tests, so I think it… I think it's a reasonable

115
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.239
Spencer: A reasonable idea, from my side.

116
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:22.410
Mario Vega: Yeah, okay, so I think nevertheless, we do need some EIP, PR as a basis on where to… how to… how to write the tests.

117
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.549
Mario Vega: How do we handle that if we're gonna do halfway?

118
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.980
Mario Vega: DAP AP3… 837?

119
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.789
Spencer: I think I have a PR open just now, so maybe I can…

120
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:44.719
Spencer: I can add the change there, and we can use that as the base, but I'm not sure on what the number should be for, cost per state byte.

121
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.799
Spencer: I guess you can use the formula. I can use the formula to figure out.

122
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.870
Spencer: For, like, maybe, like, 100, 100 million.

123
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:59.119
Maria Silva: Yeah, so I would suggest using the formula for the block limit we are targeting for DevNet 3.

124
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.290
Maria Silva: If it's 100, then we should use 100.

125
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.990
Maria Silva: Yeah, in terms of the update to the IP,

126
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:18.189
Maria Silva: So, if I understand correctly, we would now have an EIP that would have a fixed cost per byte, and then for DevNet 4, we would change again the EIP, is this correct?

127
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:26.969
Mario Vega: Yeah, that's my, my question is, where are we gonna… where is everyone gonna reference this ephemeral change from?

128
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.190
Mario Vega: Including tests, and including declines.

129
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.360
Mario Vega: Just for everyone to be on the same page for Definite Tree.

130
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.030
Maria Silva: Would it… would it make sense to just be a spec version?

131
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.670
Maria Silva: Instead of changing the EIP itself, or would that be worse?

132
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:53.720
Mario Vega: I think that's a question for client teams. Do we feel like referencing ills in this time around would be okay?

133
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.390
Mario Vega: If we don't have the EIP changes, because… yeah.

134
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.760
Mario Vega: And Dragon mentions in the chat that Devon3, how come this is a good place?

135
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.250
Mario Vega: Alright.

136
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:11.840
Mario Vega: Who's gonna be in charge of, doing this,

137
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:19.959
Mario Vega: this spec reference. Do we need a markdown document? That's my question. Or can we reference a PR in yields?

138
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.080
Mario Vega: For this?

139
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:28.030
Barnabas: We can reference, PR. Just point me to the PR, and then I will update the spec sheet.

140
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.010
Barnabas: And then, we can reference that.

141
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.629
Barnabas: And I will also highlight it, maybe on the top of the…

142
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.400
Barnabas: Spec sheet that this is, an edge case.

143
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:48.289
Mario Vega: Makes sense. Okay, so coming back to ills for this, Spencer, your… does your PR work for this? Can we reference it?

144
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.580
Mario Vega: For 103?

145
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.259
Spencer: Yeah, no, definitely. Sounds good.

146
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:02.859
Mario Vega: Alright, seems like we have a plan. Alright, just to,

147
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:17.819
Mario Vega: leave everything clear. We're gonna do a hard-coded cost-per-byte version for log-level access list number 3. Debnet 3, sorry. We're gonna use an ills PR for this.

148
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.040
Mario Vega: And then for DevNet 4, we're gonna reference the actual EIP for the implementations.

149
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.329
Mario Vega: In terms of when can we release the tests,

150
00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:38.089
Mario Vega: Spencer, do you need more time for the changes? If… taking all of this into account, do you think we need more time for the tests anyway?

151
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.750
Spencer: I think I'll be able to get something out by, ACDE.

152
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.140
Mario Vega: Okay.

153
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:54.779
Mario Vega: Sounds good. Alright, so… tests would be out for Thursday, is that…

154
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.649
Mario Vega: Reasonable for everyone?

155
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.920
Mario Vega: Marius Barnabas? Mario?

156
00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.190
Barnabas: Yeah, from our point of view, it's not an issue.

157
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.620
Mario Vega: Good.

158
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.690
Mario Vega: Good, perfect. Okay, it seems like,

159
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.309
Mario Vega: We have a… we have a plan?

160
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.879
Mario Vega: Does anybody have any questions?

161
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.489
Mario Vega: Regarding them the tree?

162
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:39.989
Spencer: Just while we're, here, I think I also mentioned, so this is, on 1837, something that, Sam Wilson,

163
00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.579
Spencer: Brought up, basically about how tracing is handled.

164
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:51.599
Spencer: So I think in the yields PR we have right now, we've added a state gas and a state gas cost to the…

165
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:57.620
Spencer: The tracer, is this something that… El clients are happy with.

166
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.159
Spencer: Yeah, I'm not a client dev. I don't use tracing much, actually, so…

167
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:08.980
Marius van der Wijden: Sorry, Ken.

168
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.720
Parithosh Jayanthi: deal.

169
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:11.790
Parithosh Jayanthi: here.

170
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.970
Marius van der Wijden: That is the… 3155 change, yeah, I think that's good.

171
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.750
Mario Vega: Okay.

172
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:42.699
Mario Vega: Great. So, moving on, alright, let me just…

173
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:50.459
Mario Vega: touch upon briefly the other EIP that has been included in DevNet3, which is EIP7954.

174
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.520
Mario Vega: Any discussion points regarding this?

175
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.039
Mario Vega: That anyone would like to bring up?

176
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.799
Mario Vega: Or are we good in those, in those regards?

177
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.299
Mario Vega: Okay, seems like a non-issue.

178
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:37.300
Mario Vega: I'll just go ahead. The next point in the agenda is EPVS, but first, let me pause before going into the CL side of things. There's one other topic that's regarding the EL, which is, the new endpoint, the testing build block comparison number one. I'll… let me just share the link.

179
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:50.189
Mario Vega: Basically, Paratush wanted to see if we could, make this implementation mandatory for clients, starting from DevNet 4.

180
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.080
Mario Vega: Because it helps testing, it helps benchmarking, it helps several things.

181
00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:04.629
Mario Vega: So, I would like to touch base with the client teams regarding their opinions on this new endpoint and their status.

182
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:14.110
Mario Vega: I think, also, never mind, if you can… you guys can share, I think you're… you are… you guys are the, authors of this new endpoint.

183
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:20.530
Mario Vega: So if you have any recommendations, also please feel free to chime in. Yep.

184
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.960
Mario Vega: So, Bari, do we have more context on this?

185
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:44.240
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, there… maybe there's one design note as to why we want to add a new, new endpoint to begin with. So typically in the past, we would have done this in the debug namespace. The problem with the debug namespace is that a lot of public, RPCs, etc.

186
00:34:44.400 --> 00:35:03.469
Parithosh Jayanthi: against recommendation by default, expose debug, because there's some functionality with Ethereum RPCs that cannot be achieved without exposing the debug namespace. The problem with, adding this testing API to the debug namespace is this would allow you to abuse the debug namespace to build whatever blocks you want.

187
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:12.829
Parithosh Jayanthi: In order to just keep these things separate, we wanted to introduce the testing namespace. It's also just the first RPC call in the testing namespace, and there's a lot more we can do in the future.

188
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:23.379
Parithosh Jayanthi: this RPC call would also help us a ton with, with your benchmarking, because you would then, in the future, be able to just provide a list of transactions.

189
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:36.069
Parithosh Jayanthi: And get a built block as a result. It should simplify quite a few things in quite a few places, and yeah, thanks to the Nethermind team and for Chase for writing the tests and coming up with the spec for this.

190
00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:41.710
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, now we just want to make sure that all the clients have an implementation so that we can move forward with it.

191
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:53.599
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you. Client apps, Do you guys need,

192
00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.869
Mario Vega: Anything to implement this, or do you oppose implementation?

193
00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.779
Mario Vega: Please chime in.

194
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:15.629
Mario Vega: Alright, there's no pushback, I guess we can make this,

195
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:22.669
Mario Vega: a requirement. We can bring it up next week also, regarding this… the status of this, and how…

196
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.129
Mario Vega: Things are going.

197
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.240
Mario Vega: Alright.

198
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.490
Mario Vega: Perfect. Okay.

199
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:29.240
Dustin: I, I guess…

200
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:29.710
Mario Vega: Ms.

201
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:48.309
Dustin: I just wanted to, like, make one… a general… I mean, Barnabas already said this, and I already… like, I actually feel pretty strongly about the merge-then-talk-about requirement thing. I mean, if… if people are willing to stipulate that, well, it will be merged, and it looks like that's being stated, then…

202
00:36:48.590 --> 00:37:04.970
Dustin: fine, that's okay. But I… I'm a little… a little tired of these kind of, YOLO's, you know, quasi-specs, which are, like, draft EIPs that get required for some DevNet. Like, please, no, no more of those. Emerge, then require.

203
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:21.759
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, maybe just a direct, answer for that one. We were lacking the ability to generate the tests because we needed an implementation in order to generate the tests. It's a downside of how the RPC test gen works today.

204
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:36.399
Parithosh Jayanthi: There was a blocker, blocker's been solved, and at least as of end of last week, we have the tests, which is why it hasn't been merged yet, but we will get it merged this week, because the counterpoint is that we don't want to merge an EIP without… or, API change without tests.

205
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.720
Mario Vega: Yes, Camille?

206
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:56.440
Kamil Chodoła: What I just want to add is, like, this is a separate namespace. It shouldn't contradict with any feature right now, and anyone basic… any client team can basically implement it without a risk of breaking something else if done properly.

207
00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:13.500
Kamil Chodoła: And as Pari also explained, there was a huge, need of doing that, because, for example, for some stateful generations of tests to unlock completely new areas of testing for benchmarking, we needed to use some hacked versions of clients, hacked versions of Nethermind to basically

208
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:28.470
Kamil Chodoła: proceed with any generation on top of existing states, and this is allowing to use any client, this is unlocking plenty of potential opportunities for better benchmarking, for better test generation. It's already proven to improve

209
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:42.610
Kamil Chodoła: by a few times the test generation on top of existing state of mainnet or blotnet. So, these are quite nice ideas to include and implement, and it will allow

210
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:58.459
Kamil Chodoła: to improve the testing capabilities of the clients in very, very various ways, like, not only just to build a block, but also to trigger the building of the invalid blocks, to help with balls, which Jocham is already exploring right now. So, a lot of

211
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:05.050
Kamil Chodoła: Potential upsides and very small negative impacts, in my opinion, at least.

212
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:12.959
Mario Vega: Okay, thank you.

213
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:29.120
Mario Vega: Justin, I see your comment on the, on the chat. Yeah, I agree. This is, this is a problem. I don't think… I mean, at least… I know you're referring to…

214
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.210
Mario Vega: Execution APs, specifically, but I think from the spec side.

215
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.169
Mario Vega: For EIP testing, ills has been…

216
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.899
Mario Vega: Helping us out to build the tests without any client implementation.

217
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.460
Mario Vega: And it's getting better?

218
00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:51.410
Mario Vega: Yeah. Would you mind expanding a little bit on this, or…

219
00:39:51.410 --> 00:40:13.759
Justin Florentine (Besu): I don't really want to derail things, I just wanted to point out that this happens very regularly, and we get caught in this dependency loop where we can't create tests because we don't have an implementation, and it seems very broken and backwards to me, is all. I think you get it, I think most folks on the call get it, so I won't belabor the point. I do appreciate that it's mostly an RPC issue, and that

220
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:21.559
Justin Florentine (Besu): the broader Eels test don't suffer from that problem. So, it seems to be going in the right direction, but boy, it's been a challenge for quite some time.

221
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:35.609
Mario Vega: Agreed. Okay, yeah, let's keep moving, then.

222
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:41.440
Mario Vega: Yeah, going back to EPVS, DevNet Zero, sorry.

223
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:46.060
Mario Vega: Do we have any updates?

224
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.320
Mario Vega: And let me see the comment from Justin in the…

225
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:09.559
Mario Vega: Alright, so Justin, you have a comment on the agenda at the moment, but this is for Fossil, right? This is.

226
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.040
Justin Traglia: Different from EBS.

227
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.719
Justin Traglia: I mean, there's just a note at the top that says that the…

228
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:24.280
Justin Traglia: Also, spikes have been renamed to EZ, but there were just some PRs that I want core devs to review that are related to EPBS.

229
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.119
Justin Traglia: But, we don't have to talk about that.

230
00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.069
Mario Vega: Alright, do you need any help?

231
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.160
Mario Vega: Or… input from the core labs, at this point?

232
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.020
Justin Traglia: Oh, yeah. Reviews would be great.

233
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.660
Mario Vega: Yeah.

234
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:45.400
Mario Vega: And anything else, that they need to implement, other than reviews, or…

235
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.579
Justin Traglia: At the moment, I don't think so.

236
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:11.909
Mario Vega: Alright, and I see some comments in the chat from Nico. It seems like, Lone Star and Lighthouse do have interrupt for EPBS, and tech mentions that they can have interrupt ready towards the end of the week, or early next week.

237
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.599
Mario Vega: Yes.

238
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.180
Mario Vega: I think that's it.

239
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:27.910
Mario Vega: And Prysm will not make it in by this week, but we, they are gonna try to aim for next week. Alright.

240
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:32.219
Mario Vega: Anything else regarding the EPBS that needs to be discussed today?

241
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.629
Mario Vega: Barnabas, would you like to mention that?

242
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:55.510
Barnabas: Yeah, so I would propose that we have a realistic,

243
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.450
Barnabas: launch date for EPBS Demo Zero on the 4th of March.

244
00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:10.990
Barnabas: We will do a launch no matter how many clients are ready, but ideally we have at least 3, ideally 4 ready for that day.

245
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:24.499
Mario Vega: Sounds good, and from the reading of the comments from chat, it seems like we will do have at least 3 clients for that date, so I think it should be okay.

246
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.180
Mario Vega: Alright.

247
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.970
Mario Vega: Good.

248
00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.350
Mario Vega: Anything else for EPS? I don't think so, right?

249
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:45.550
Mario Vega: Now that we can just keep going. The next, item in the agenda is, gas limit testing.

250
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:51.530
Mario Vega: or benchmarking. Camille or anyone else, would you like to give an update on this?

251
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.789
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, so mostly we are focusing right now on repricing's effort.

252
00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:05.820
Kamil Chodoła: doing a lot of back-and-forth fighting with some failures during generation, but I guess right now we are on a good spot.

253
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:13.069
Kamil Chodoła: With all the tests which are required, likely generated already, and some data already collected.

254
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:29.529
Kamil Chodoła: for that purpose. The only stuff is that new tests which are running on top of state of mainnet or bloatnet are pretty long to execute, and single loop of gathering all of the data points for all of the scenarios in all required,

255
00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.180
Kamil Chodoła: Conditions is, like, more than a day, just to capture one data point.

256
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:48.829
Kamil Chodoła: for all the clients. And so, yeah, so right now, trying to solve that and see where we can either cut the time of the execution or parallelize more on more machines. So this is being discussed right now. So this is the main effort.

257
00:44:48.990 --> 00:45:00.619
Kamil Chodoła: You worked heavily also with Mario last week to optimize the generation significantly, so there are some few cool new stuff, either on ills or on Generator's side.

258
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.500
Kamil Chodoła: But rather than that, yeah, we are progressing

259
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:13.029
Kamil Chodoła: waiting for some inputs, additional inputs from Maria for new tests, but yeah, those landed over the weekend, and I still need to check a few issues.

260
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.090
Mario Vega: Sounds good. Yeah, sorry.

261
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:36.729
Maria Silva: Maybe I can just give a quick update on my side. So I'm… I am… last week, I was looking at the first, data that was coming out from the benchmarks that Camille was saying… was saying, and, yeah, I do… we… we have found

262
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:42.170
Maria Silva: a few issues on how the tests are defined, like, they are not measuring the exact

263
00:45:42.380 --> 00:46:00.090
Maria Silva: variants that we needed, like, for instance, an S slow that is warm versus cold, like, there was some… some… some, some changes that we need to do to… to… to… to the test, so it's still a work in progress, so I don't think we'll have

264
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:15.330
Maria Silva: the final, or the intermediate numbers for EIP 8038, so the state access EIP, by the end of this month. But yeah, we are working on it and hoping to get numbers as fast as possible.

265
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.110
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

266
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:31.649
Mario Vega: Alright, so moving on to the next topic, state load. I think, Camille, you're also in…

267
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.949
Mario Vega: Topic things in this topic?

268
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:49.600
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, so we had a major issue recently with BloatNet, due to the scale right now of the BloatNet and the ratio which we put, and some random problems, for example, with NetherMite Corrupted at an unexpected moments.

269
00:46:49.620 --> 00:47:00.029
Kamil Chodoła: We had a bloat which went down, but thanks to Philip, we have it back online, and it's bloating, and as far as I know.

270
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:11.650
Kamil Chodoła: we also reached a new goal… I mean, we hit the milestone of blocking specific contracts to the certain size, which would be much bigger than the current biggest contracts on the chain.

271
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:20.059
Kamil Chodoła: So, right now, the snapshots collection is being in progress, and yeah, moving forward, we need to…

272
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:26.490
Kamil Chodoła: Discuss how we want to… how we want to blot, because seems like this,

273
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:40.369
Kamil Chodoła: This approach which we have right now with a network and bloating, and clients are going down from time to time is not sufficient, especially if we keep in mind that we want to bloat at some point to 10x or something like that.

274
00:47:40.410 --> 00:48:00.179
Kamil Chodoła: So that's why, for example, Martin from our team is right now investigating some possibilities to create a custom tools, plus Johan and Tony are working on a state injection tool, as I recall. So some research around optimizing this approach is happening in parallel.

275
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:10.219
Parithosh Jayanthi: There's maybe two points to that one. The first one is we haven't started snapshots yet, because we're still waiting on Eragon to sync up.

276
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:30.230
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think Will asked a few questions earlier today, I haven't gotten to it, but, I can answer that, and once Ergon is ready, we should be ready to take a snapshot. We're gonna do two snapshots, one before Fusaka is scheduled in, in Bloodnet, and the second one is after Fusaka is scheduled, so that we have, both of those dates available.

277
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:40.069
Parithosh Jayanthi: But, to the other question of how we move forward, I actually wanted to challenge that assumption, because the reason BloatNet is failing is that

278
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:56.109
Parithosh Jayanthi: is that clients can't handle the state already. I would actually propose that we try and figure out why clients are breaking right now, rather than just getting to a 10x state, because we're already breaking. I don't really see the benefit of continuing to increase the state size.

279
00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:58.240
Marius van der Wijden: Whoa.

280
00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:03.710
Marius van der Wijden: Are clients really failing because of the state size, or the amount of state growth?

281
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:15.040
Parithosh Jayanthi: Well, state size plus gas limit as a combination. So, yeah, if we do 100 million gas, we're breaking, but last time I checked, I think we were breaking at 300 million gas with the state, which…

282
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.600
Parithosh Jayanthi: Is kind of a realistic target, right?

283
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:23.829
Marius van der Wijden: I thought we… we are currently at, like, 3 giga gas or something on…

284
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:33.769
Kamil Chodoła: Let me maybe clarify the recent weeks, what was happening. So, basically, we started increasing gas limit.

285
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:48.949
Kamil Chodoła: And a few issues which we spotted was, like, GEF was running some invalid flags at all, which were not properly applied from mainnet into BloatNet, so, like, we are facing some issues which are… actually might not be the real issue.

286
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:57.779
Kamil Chodoła: In plenty of scenarios. Nethermind is corrupting, and we cannot reproduce that locally at all.

287
00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:05.749
Kamil Chodoła: So, that's why I was hinting a few times at the hardware issues rather than the software issues, but I cannot

288
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:17.269
Kamil Chodoła: prove both, actually. So, the reason I'm mentioning some different approaches toward Test 10X is because of a few reasons, like, we want to eventually reach that at some point.

289
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:29.109
Kamil Chodoła: happen in parallel while solving the issues, because I guess at some point we might have solved the issue on 3X whatsoever, and next issues might pop out at 5x.

290
00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:39.830
Kamil Chodoła: So if we'll parallelize both efforts, we will be able to verify issues at 5x straight away, rather than waiting, bloating, dealing with some instabilities.

291
00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:41.230
Kamil Chodoła: During that time.

292
00:50:41.320 --> 00:51:00.650
Kamil Chodoła: So, it would allow us to progress a little bit faster. While I agree that this is highlighting some potential problems which we maybe should tackle early, but till now, some of those problems weren't strictly related to the issues in plants rather than configurations and some

293
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.749
Kamil Chodoła: Randomness which is happening.

294
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:04.710
Kamil Chodoła: During bloating.

295
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:16.120
Parithosh Jayanthi: Maybe there's one exercise to try. So right now, the approach with bloating is take all the keys, put it on one machine that's able to build blocks, and then continue on with the network.

296
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:28.960
Parithosh Jayanthi: Maybe the way to figure out exactly where we break is redistribute the keys equally, and then go to 300 million gas, see if it can actually build blocks across clients. If we're not able to do that.

297
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:40.880
Parithosh Jayanthi: then I think we have a problem already. And, to Maurice's point, yeah, we are going at Giga Gas or whatever, but that's only happening because one client is building all the blocks, not all the clients.

298
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.450
Parithosh Jayanthi: One or two clients, let's say.

299
00:51:55.210 --> 00:52:03.350
Mario Vega: Alright, I just wanted to close, well, I don't want… I didn't want to close the topic. Camille, do you agree with these approaches?

300
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.039
Kamil Chodoła: Yes, sorry, I understand. So, yes,

301
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:22.569
Kamil Chodoła: Actually, Gregory, but still, I believe we could explore something, because in case we want to test on some much higher numbers, there will be a huge value in having something which could allow us to test some…

302
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:28.249
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, yeah, some, like, local… local bloating approach does make sense for that.

303
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:34.569
Kamil Chodoła: Yes, this is exactly what I mean, like, local bloating, and you can always spun up the network from that point.

304
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:41.290
Kamil Chodoła: We know about some issues during syncing when the gas limit is way too high, but yeah.

305
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:58.579
Kamil Chodoła: some possibility to do that much more convenient way and much more predictable way, rather than… yeah, I guess the assumption was to have the current blot to be completed already, like, a few weeks ago, but due to some random issues, we were…

306
00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.550
Kamil Chodoła: Suspending that for quite some time, so…

307
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:08.350
Mario Vega: I'm good.

308
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:17.089
Mario Vega: Thank you. I think that's everything for today's agenda. Do we have any other topic that anybody wants to bring up?

309
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.679
Mario Vega: Needs to be discussed today.

310
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:19.890
Mario Vega: Johan, yeah?

311
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:30.890
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, there's one point, and I just realized that I should have raised this before, but for the benchmarking for the block for access list, we actually need to fill these tests for Amsterdam.

312
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:36.539
jochem-brouwer: So we need the testing build block API to support, building the…

313
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:43.559
jochem-brouwer: MCLM block, so we can actually start benchmarking states-related tests for the block FX list.

314
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.380
Mario Vega: Yes, come in.

315
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:56.260
Kamil Chodoła: So yeah, I guess, for the Netarmine implementation, Margin already started doing… I mean, not even started, he's having some draft implementation of…

316
00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:03.710
Kamil Chodoła: Testing build block with a possibility to pass a fork on top of which we want to build blocks, so hopefully this will help.

317
00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:17.879
Marcin Sobczak: Yes, I have some issues with it, but it's work in progress, and yes, at the end, we want to be able to build on every fork.

318
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.550
Mario Vega: Sounds good.

319
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.410
Mario Vega: Okay.

320
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.349
Mario Vega: Anything else?

321
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.709
Mario Vega: anyone wants to bring up today?

322
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:47.700
Barnabas: I can just confirm that, Lodestar and Lighthouse are actually interoping locally on, like, glutosis test.

323
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.600
Barnabas: So, good job.

324
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.529
Mario Vega: Amazing. Great news.

325
00:54:56.150 --> 00:55:05.169
Ahmad: Hey, quick. Yeah, quick question. So, for those who are…

326
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.410
Ahmad: I mean, not completely new, but…

327
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:13.789
Ahmad: Relatively new, who are trying to, onboard, just understand the, the tooling processes,

328
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:28.569
Ahmad: Better. There's the, the testing, like, group, channel grouping in the ETH R&D Discord server. Is that generally the, the place to go to kind of, like, research and just familiarize, someone's…

329
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:45.570
Ahmad: For someone to familiarize themselves with the, the tooling processes, like Kurtosis, Dora the Explorer, Hive, all of that. Or is there a better, place? Perhaps, like, a GitHub issue, or Doc, or some… something that's.

330
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:45.950
Mario Vega: Yeah.

331
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:47.130
Ahmad: more organized? Just curious.

332
00:55:47.130 --> 00:56:00.420
Mario Vega: I think 8 R&D is the best place to… and yeah, we can take it async, just to not hold off everyone. But yeah, 8th R&D should be the place where you chime in, and someone will probably just help you out with the onboarding.

333
00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.020
Ahmad: June.

334
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.049
Ahmad: Got it, got it. Okay, cool.

335
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.490
Mario Vega: Alright.

336
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:15.070
Mario Vega: Cool. Thanks, everyone, I think that's it for today. Yeah, thanks everyone for joining, and we'll see, everyone in ACDE this week.

337
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:21.449
Marius van der Wijden: Sorry, Okay. Ahmad? Ahmad? Ahmad?

338
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.199
Marius van der Wijden: Ahmed? Oh.

339
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:24.590
Ahmad: bod.

340
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:39.140
Marius van der Wijden: Ahmad? Ahmad? Okay, perfect. There's, epf.wiki, which has a bunch of information, so, if… if you are looking for information about development, or, like, the testing stuff.

341
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.110
Marius van der Wijden: epf.wiki.

342
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:46.170
Ahmad: Right on, right on. I appreciate it. Noted.

343
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.760
Mario Vega: Thank you. Excellent. Right.

344
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:58.240
Mario Vega: Okay.

345
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.759
Mario Vega: Thanks, everyone, again. Thanks for joining. We'll see everyone in ACDE this week.

346
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.529
Mario Vega: Thank you, bye-bye.

347
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.680
Dragan Rakita: Bye.

348
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.650
Parithosh Jayanthi: Aye.

349
00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:10.710
Justin Traglia: Bye, everyone.

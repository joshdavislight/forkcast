This is on block building, didn’t use good gas limit for 7778
00:22:07	Jen:	Replying to "re: reth missing blo..."

Yep PR was merged, any more action needed from our side?
00:22:32	Barnabas:	Replying to "re: reth missing blo..."

Ok, so you didn’t store anything invalid in your db?
00:23:06	Dustin:	if a postponement decision is made can it be made soon?
00:23:07	Dragan Rakita:	Replying to "re: reth missing blo..."

That would be the case
00:23:10	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "re: reth missing blo..."

Yeah afaik it was just about missing blocks, not a db corruption

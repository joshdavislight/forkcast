00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.369
Jihoon: Hey guys, I think we can wait a few more minutes.

2
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.870
Jihoon: Alright, I think we can kick it off.

3
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.609
Jihoon: So, hello everyone, welcome to FOCIL Breakout 29.

4
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.480
Jihoon: First off, FOCIL has SFI for Pectra.

5
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.340
Jihoon: Thank you everyone who has been working on and supporting FOCIL.

6
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.040
Jihoon: In response to that, I've realized also spec on Gloas, and then promoted it to here. As he…

7
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.729
Jihoon: Here I was referring to CL spec, execution specs, and Engine APIs, or…

8
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:15.830
Jihoon: still outdated, but I don't expect any meaningful changes there, to be honest. I'm still discussing with spec maintainers.

9
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.220
Jihoon: On how to go about that rebasing.

10
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.190
Jihoon: Let me quickly share the link to the… as he's back.

11
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.150
Jihoon: Yeah, here's a spec, and… The gist of the spec change is… So…

12
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.019
Jihoon: let's say if you're in slot N, and when we receive a peak on block.

13
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:57.059
Jihoon: or near the attestation deadline for slot N, we call it get head, right? And if there was a payload for slot N minus 1,

14
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.990
Jihoon: We get to decide whether to extend that payload or not.

15
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.930
Jihoon: So any PBS, we rework a payload when half of PTC vote against it.

16
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.320
Jihoon: the beacon block for slot N was timely, and it chose to reorog the payload for slot N-1.

17
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.929
Jihoon: In here, we… let me fossil add a new condition that

18
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.559
Jihoon: If the payload was not IL compliant, we just reorgan.

19
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:36.049
Jihoon: So, with this condition, when a payload was not IL compliant, attesters don't vote for it, and a proposer doesn't extend it.

20
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:48.660
Jihoon: And yeah, that's the… I think that's the main change of the fossil spec. So, yep, that's it. That's for the spec update. Do we have any questions or any other updates?

21
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.130
Jihoon: Alright, thank… We don't have any questions.

22
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.560
Jihoon: Do we have any development updates?

23
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.329
Fabio Di Fabio: Not a real update, but, on a Besu.

24
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.959
Fabio Di Fabio: We are starting this week.

25
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:46.540
Fabio Di Fabio: Necessary activities for… integrating FOCIL to Besu.

26
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:59.780
Jihoon: Nice, will it gonna be… on top of… Glamsterdam? Or… Fusaka?

27
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.530
Fabio Di Fabio: It… On top of Glamsterdam, yes. Because we are…

28
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:17.390
Fabio Di Fabio: already many EIP for Glamsterdam that are our main, so… we usually… Right.

29
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.140
Fabio Di Fabio: To keep all the new features on Maine.

30
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.769
Fabio Di Fabio: As quickly as possible, and so you should be on top of that.

31
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.580
Jihoon: Nice, nice.

32
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.680
Jihoon: Okay, so… Yeah, it's really good to hear it.

33
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:41.190
Jihoon: And I think the next step forward Ahead of us, but be…

34
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.749
Jihoon: besides the spec updates, I think it will be a spec test, so that

35
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.019
Jihoon: We can provide test factors for clients.

36
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.200
Jihoon: So… Yeah, if we can have…

37
00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.150
Jihoon: best prototype on top of Glamsterdam, then… I think it…

38
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.009
Jihoon: It will really come in handy when we test.

39
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.139
Jihoon: Possible. So, yeah, really good to hear it.

40
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:19.210
Jihoon: Okay, if we don't have any other updates, then…

41
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.430
Jihoon: We can go ahead and wrap up this call.

42
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:37.119
Jihoon: By the way, nico, we have a PBS implementation on Lodestar. Do you think…

43
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.070
Jihoon: Is it gonna make sense to…

44
00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.989
Jihoon: implement fossil on top of it, or is it still premature?

45
00:08:45.440 --> 00:09:02.270
nflaig: Right now, it's not yet possible, because we have not yet merged everything into our unstable. That's on the ePBS DevNet Zero. So, I think we need to clean that up first a bit, and get it, more reviewed and cleaned up.

46
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:10.759
nflaig: And then we can rebase our fossil branch against that, because it's based on unstable branch right now, not the ePBS devnet.

47
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.559
Jihoon: As it.

48
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:20.769
nflaig: But yeah, maybe, 2 weeks or something? Maybe we can try to rebase it on clause.

49
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:32.590
Jihoon: do we… wait for… Like, field deafness, or, like, deafness zero would be fine to rebase fossil.

50
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:51.130
nflaig: Yeah, I think the devnet zero scope, should cover everything for fossil. I don't think anything we add in later… oh, wait, maybe not. It doesn't cover the PTC, so we don't, want to implement that in devnet zero.

51
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.779
nflaig: So maybe devnet one.

52
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.140
Jihoon: I see.

53
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.460
Jihoon: So… Yeah, silly.

54
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.399
Jihoon: It's not… far out, so it would be, I don't know, a few weeks or 1 or 2 months.

55
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.219
nflaig: Yeah, I think at least from our side, we would like to have something, before the Interop. I think that's doable.

56
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.570
Jihoon: Sounds great.

57
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:35.559
Jihoon: Okay, thanks for sharing the updates. If we don't have any other updates, then we can…

58
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.970
Jihoon: Rabbias called Oli.

59
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.090
Jihoon: Alright, thank you guys, have a great rest of your day, and see you guys in 2 weeks!

60
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.180
Fabio Di Fabio: Thank you. Oh, bye.

61
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.010
Jihoon: Yeah, Palette did share something on the chat, I'm sorry I didn't see it.

62
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.330
Jihoon: Maybe, you wanna share something, Pelot?

63
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:11.030
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, I can talk for a quick second. These two charts are just what I've seen so far using the block-native data, which has been a lot easier to work with, but basically…

64
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:21.789
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: The overview is with the top fee IL building, we're looking at about 85% for the zero slot delay, so the current implementation, and then…

65
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:32.840
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: We… Moving to the two-slot delay, it changes by about the same amount as I was talking last week. Let me just pull it up.

66
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:47.139
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, you're going from 84% of the transactions in the inclusion list are included in the next spot, block already, and then with the delays, it gets up to 85.

67
00:11:47.520 --> 00:12:05.009
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: So, not too much of a difference there. And… I found some more issues with this, so this is just a sneak peek, but, just wanted to show this off as well. And then, actual censored inclusion lists are also about the same as the

68
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:18.540
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: XL… XL data I shared last time, but the inclusion rates are a lot higher with this block native data, so I'm assuming… so I have some more testing to do, but we're looking at about 95%

69
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:26.350
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: of transactions included in these inclusion lists with the top fee, building structure.

70
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.819
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Are essentially a waste of bandwidth, but yeah.

71
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.790
Jihoon: Okay, great. Yeah. Thanks for sharing.

72
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.540
Jihoon: Nice.

73
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:45.830
Jihoon: So, I think the idea would be…

74
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:56.890
Jihoon: Sorry, I haven't read your document fully, but I guess the plan is to update the script to get more precise data?

75
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:08.680
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, there was an issue with the config, and just due to the volume of all the data, it's taking my laptop a couple days to process, so, it's kind of just waiting on that, really.

76
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.700
Jihoon: Cool.

77
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.720
Jihoon: Yeah.

78
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.229
Jihoon: Thanks for sharing.

79
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:26.580
Jihoon: Alright, I think we can really go ahead and wrap this call. Alright, thank you guys. Stay in 2 weeks. Thank you.

80
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.250
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Thank you.

81
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.090
Jihoon: Bye-bye.

00:10:23	Stefan Starflinger:	Im back from my holiday where did everyone go 😂
00:12:26	Karim T. (matkt):	Why not creating a shadow fork and build new blocks with transactions of the mainnet transaction pool ?
00:13:06	felipe:	which endpoint is this @jochem-brouwer? `testing_buildBlockV1`?

If this is related to benchmarks, we want to really stress test the client. So "normal" mainnet texs are not sufficient here because they are not stressing the client enough. We want to generate "worst case blocks" and try to also abuse the BAL to generate worst cases there (for instance batch I/O where the storage is being loaded in reverse order than they are ordered in the BAL)
00:14:07	Stefan Starflinger:	Its not very cheap to setup a shadow fork and we generally prefer to have multiple clients ready before taking this on
00:14:22	jochem-brouwer:	Replying to "which endpoint is ..."

Yup! Nethermind is working on this to support Glamsterdam (already supports Osaka)

00:14:41	Stefan Starflinger:	Whats the status on the benchmarkoor integration
00:14:48	felipe:	Replying to "which endpoint is ..."

Ah yep. We now support this in STEEL as well 👍

Ok I think it’s also important to have the two kind of tests
00:14:56	felipe:	Reacted to "Yup! Nethermind is..." with 👍
00:15:18	jochem-brouwer:	Replying to "Whats the status o..."

Benchmarkoor should be able to run this, the problem is we cannot fill the benchmarks to plug those into benchmarkoor (this is this testing_endpointV1)
00:15:33	Stefan Starflinger:	Replying to "Whats the status on …"
I see
00:16:14	jochem-brouwer:	Replying to "Whats the status o..."

So need one client to use as benchmark filler. It is not the same as "normal test filling", because for the benchmarks to make sense we need to run it on top of state and not on top on empty or super small state (because the operations are extremely fast there anyways)

We have a PR in Besu for that not sure how close we are to merge it
00:19:41	Toni Wahrstätter:	https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/11323
00:20:58	felipe:	https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/11223#discussion_r2849777995
00:26:17	Karim T. (matkt):	In Besu we are also checking the order of the keys
00:28:30	felipe:	swap tx index order test: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/forks/amsterdam/tests/amsterdam/eip7928_block_level_access_lists/test_block_access_lists_invalid.py#L296
00:29:07	felipe:	Replying to "swap tx index orde..."

also swapping address ordering... yeah we have these
00:29:41	Toni Wahrstätter:	This is the PR on the json rpc:
https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1944
00:30:21	Karim T. (matkt):	Already merged in besu
00:30:43	Karim T. (matkt):	Replying to "swap tx index order ..."

Talking about checking before block processing
00:37:36	Jared Wasinger:	I have a conflicting call.  gotta go 🙁

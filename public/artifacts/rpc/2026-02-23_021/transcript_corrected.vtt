00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.700
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello.

2
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.260
Ahmad: blew them out in LA last night.

3
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.860
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Oh.

4
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.310
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining.

5
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.900
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Amazing.

6
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.670
Zane Starr: Hey.

7
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.860
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I think we can start, but let me share the agenda.

8
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.769
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So… Hello, everyone. Welcome to RPC Standard Call 21.

9
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.620
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We… I wasn't here during the last call.

10
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.160
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And, although I went through, through the, call somewhere.

11
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.920
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And I did map out this, file.

12
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.529
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Isaac MD proposal for the versioning that we talked about… we've been talking about since the beginning of this year.

13
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.659
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I don't know if anyone had taken a look at it and have any suggestion or impute on it.

14
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.500
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello, Felix.

15
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.930
Felix (Geth): Hello?

16
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.700
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I, I have taken a look at it. I think it makes a lot of sense.

17
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.909
Felix (Geth): The basic question is just how we exactly,

18
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.249
Felix (Geth): Pull off the versioning, but we had some thoughts on it, so the way it should work is that, yeah.

19
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.199
Felix (Geth): a GitHub release has to be created.

20
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.090
Felix (Geth): of the V1, and we…

21
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.029
Felix (Geth): Can basically do that at any time.

22
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.540
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, okay, thank you for that. So… .

23
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.730
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello?

24
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.139
Felix (Geth): I don't know how.

25
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.280
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sorry, my… I don't know what's wrong with my internet connection.

26
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:19.249
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, as I was saying, I'm not sure who we are going to contact for, like, who will be responsible for the GitHub release, so I'm not sure if that will be you.

27
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.560
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Because the money, you didn'.

28
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.079
Felix (Geth): It's gonna be me, y'all.

29
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.119
Felix (Geth): So, we… I can… the question is, Mandy, do you… I mean, you listed some things there which are kind of…

30
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.000
Felix (Geth): still to include, I guess, so we should…

31
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.810
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah?

32
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.050
Felix (Geth): get to these PRs.

33
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.720
Felix (Geth): And then.

34
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.420
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

35
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.500
Felix (Geth): Keith, you know…

36
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.169
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: this PR, actually, this one.

37
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.669
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And this one.

38
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.749
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Although this is, like… I'm not sure about the second one, but yeah.

39
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.260
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Then also, this PR needs to be discussed, this, add max use gas.

40
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.300
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Here.

41
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.160
Felix (Geth): Yeah, that last one, is kind of a…

42
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.139
Felix (Geth): I think it's more like a… change to the API?

43
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:37.760
Felix (Geth): I mean, it makes… whatever the status of it is, I think it has to go through the process first, so I wouldn't just include it in the V1, because it is supposed to be…

44
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:49.679
Felix (Geth): we are supposed to agree on the API changes before deploying them to the spec. And so, I feel like this change with the max use gas is more, like, at the start of the process.

45
00:05:50.650 --> 00:06:07.499
Felix (Geth): So, it is being implemented, as far as I see, in Reth, but it still has an open pull request, and there's also an open pull request in GoEthereum, but that's about it. So, I think it's not at the point where it can be included into the spec, and it shouldn't be considered for this

46
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.389
Felix (Geth): Initial release of the spec.

47
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.800
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, okay, I'm trying to jot that down so that I can…

48
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.220
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: know what to include and remove from ERA.

49
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.260
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: View.

50
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.890
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, is there any other thing that should be included?

51
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.769
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: From your own perspective, apart from the things I've listed.

52
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:39.919
Felix (Geth): I'm not so super sure, no. I don't think… I mean, to be honest, it's just more about getting started with the release process in the first place, so that we can,

53
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:49.240
Felix (Geth): see what comes next, because as far as I see it with those, like, with the… with the release process, what's gonna happen is we will…

54
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.429
Felix (Geth): We will make a release of the spec, but then…

55
00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.109
Felix (Geth): Ultimately, the point of that is also to freeze the spec at its current place.

56
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:12.800
Felix (Geth): Giving clients the ability to target the released version for their tests. So we will, in the next step, have to update the test runner so that it will…

57
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.680
Felix (Geth): Use the released version of the spec.

58
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.100
Felix (Geth): Instead of the, latest one.

59
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:36.990
Felix (Geth): So I think that's something important as well, that is connected with the… with this release process. And for that, I would just say, I mean, if we… we can… if we just freeze this back as it is right now, we have a pretty good chance of…

60
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.769
Felix (Geth): Yeah, making it useful for the clients to target.

61
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:51.760
Felix (Geth): Unless they see that… unless some client sees that there are certain changes in the spec that are required in order for them to pass the test, in which case, we should just

62
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.900
Felix (Geth): Yeah, make these changes, but it's also, once we have released the version 1, we will keep

63
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.130
Felix (Geth): Making new releases all the time.

64
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.650
Felix (Geth): So I think it's more.

65
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.390
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

66
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:09.559
Felix (Geth): Yeah, it's not that important to get everything into the initial release, because literally it's not the last release.

67
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:19.790
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, what I was just thinking, going for was, like, maybe the important ones to start with, then we can slowly add up to the release.

68
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:32.390
Felix (Geth): So one change that definitely has to be made is that recently we added the block timestamp to the transaction object, so that thing needs to still be deployed into the tests.

69
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.190
Felix (Geth): I'll see what's the,

70
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.729
Felix (Geth): What's the pull request for this? I think there is an open pull request for this.

71
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.530
Felix (Geth): Let me check… For it…

72
00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:00.569
Felix (Geth): Hmm. Yeah, so the pull request was merged, but somehow the tests are not updated.

73
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:20.090
Felix (Geth): So I have to update the tests again to include this change, and this will be something that we have to do before the release, because one of the ideas was also that, as part of the release, we will publish the spec JSON, but we will also publish the tests which are associated with that version as an artifact.

74
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.520
Felix (Geth): So we basically have to…

75
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:36.839
Felix (Geth): come up with a… so before we can publish the version 1, we have to make sure that there are no regressions in the tests. And at the moment, looking at the Hive.

76
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:47.979
Felix (Geth): We have a regression in tests because most of the clients are returning this block timestamp as part of the transaction, but the tests themselves do not have this change included yet.

77
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:59.510
Felix (Geth): So we have to make this change to get all the clients back to 100… like, all the clients which were passing 100% before, Nethermine, and Geth, we have to get them all back to this state.

78
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.100
Felix (Geth): Actually, let me check.

79
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.909
Felix (Geth): I think Erigon is also at a similar…

80
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.099
Felix (Geth): Yeah, Erigon is at the same place now, so if we…

81
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:20.409
Felix (Geth): If we put it back, then Erigon will also be at 100%. So basically, I will make this change to ensure that they all pass again, and then we can,

82
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.349
Felix (Geth): We are in a good place for the tests.

83
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:32.509
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so I'll still, like, try to, like, jot this down so that we don't kind of, like, forget about it.

84
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:39.269
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And, I'm not sure if anyone has any other thing to say in regards to devotioning.

85
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.710
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Any more imputes, so that I can go to the next agenda item.

86
00:10:45.350 --> 00:11:00.229
Felix (Geth): I would like to give one more thing. So, ultimately, we also have to figure out how the versioning will be handled in the documentation side. So, at the moment, the documentation website shows the latest spec.

87
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:08.150
Felix (Geth): But, we should have a way of basically browsing the… Spec as it was released.

88
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:16.370
Felix (Geth): And so, we have to figure out how to make that happen. I think there is some work required in the GitHub Actions or something.

89
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:31.169
Felix (Geth): that will… Basically publish the latest released spec, as well as the… Yeah, like, the latest one.

90
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:43.990
Felix (Geth): Or should we maybe publish all of the documentation sites for all of the versions? I mean, that would be the ideal case, right? If we had some kind of version selector in the docs, where you could say, yeah, I want to go to…

91
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.020
Felix (Geth): 1, or version 1.1 or so. But this has to be implemented by someone.

92
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.319
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so,

93
00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:00.809
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think I would defer this to Zane, because he has, like, more knowledge about how the website works now.

94
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.669
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: If he can, like, give us a direction on how to properly do this.

95
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.990
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Take it off for my own end.

96
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:17.740
Zane Starr: Yeah, just give me, like, one second to, like, switch over, to my machine. I'm just, like, setting up my mic on it. That's why you see two of me.

97
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.870
Zane Starr: Just, like, one second. Alright.

98
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:35.099
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think this current idea makes sense, so that people can, like, easily illustrate through the various versions that we've, be more like a history.

99
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.220
Zane Starr: Let's see…

100
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:38.960
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Crazy.

101
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:46.030
Zane Starr: Hey, how's it going? Off the top of my head, I would say, like…

102
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.889
Zane Starr: Probably what you could do…

103
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:59.819
Zane Starr: I don't know if this makes total sense, but essentially, any sort of markdown that you put into the docs folder would then just be replicated.

104
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:16.469
Zane Starr: Probably your biggest thing would be, on the sidebar. So you could probably, because it is just DocuSource, is have a sidebar, and then you could just generate the docs either in Markdown or MDX.

105
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.279
Zane Starr: Because the generator can be run as a standalone CLI.

106
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:32.710
Zane Starr: And then, for there, you'd be able to have, like, on the sidebar, say, like, V1, V2, V3, and then expand into it, and then latest would just be the default.

107
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:39.320
Zane Starr: And then, versioning in terms of version number, can just go directly into the docs, I think.

108
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:55.140
Ahmad: Hey, I'm Zane. So, somewhat a new, question here, but, do you mind, or someone, whoever has on hand, linking to the, the site you're referencing, or you're referring to? Mercy, I think you, I mean, you mentioned this before.

109
00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:01.160
Ahmad: But, yeah, I'm relatively new here, just trying to get more context.

110
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.960
Ahmad: Let me share the link.

111
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:17.399
Ahmad: Oh. To the GitHub? Oh, never mind. Okay, got it. Appreciate it.

112
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:29.979
Felix (Geth): So, yeah, I mean, I would say that this sidebar thing, I'm not super sure about it, so basically this would mean that inside of the guides section or something, we would have… I mean, yeah, we can have something there, but I would…

113
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:37.279
Felix (Geth): I would rather make it so that we basically have to change the side to have some kind of version selector in the top.

114
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.649
Zane Starr: This is a very common thing, actually, for most documentation sites, that you can switch between the versions.

115
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:49.270
Felix (Geth): And how exactly we implement that, we have to see, but it has to be, like, a built-in feature of the site with, like, a…

116
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.579
Felix (Geth): That goes in the… basically in the top bar.

117
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.520
Zane Starr: Yeah, that's fine. I was just saying that, like…

118
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:05.300
Zane Starr: I mean, like, that was quick. We're, like, we want to ship something that, like, works, that doesn't take, like, a whole heck of a lot of time.

119
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.449
Zane Starr: More engineering resources to do, then you could, like… do that?

120
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.769
Zane Starr: And then that would, like, probably just, like, work today.

121
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:28.699
Zane Starr: The other thing would be is that it is just DocuSource, and that all the docs are generated, with, like, regular.mdx that's not tied to, like, any sort of platform, so…

122
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:38.150
Zane Starr: In that case, yeah, I'm sure there's a DocuSource plugin that allows you to have, like, a little drop-down menu and all that stuff, so…

123
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:49.299
Zane Starr: Yeah, it's just DocuSource. The answer is it's DocuSource, and there's a generator CLI that will produce the documents that you need. It's not…

124
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.050
Zane Starr: It doesn't, like, forcibly put you into any sort of arrangement, yeah.

125
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:00.630
Felix (Geth): Yup.

126
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:11.269
Zane Starr: And, like, that's some work that we could take up, but, like, we'd have to discuss that, like, sort of, like, offline.

127
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:23.100
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, so there's a… there is a guide here that will explain this, like, how they… how they like to have it in this,

128
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.849
Felix (Geth): in the… in the tool.

129
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:33.629
Felix (Geth): So… yeah, I mean, the main thing for us is that we want to have this integrated with the…

130
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:51.169
Felix (Geth): with the release process. So, ultimately, this comes down to documenting also the release process, like, how we publish a release. And I see us publishing releases more often than, you know, like, every year. I mean, we're definitely gonna do this process quite a bit, so…

131
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.080
Zane Starr: Yeah.

132
00:16:52.080 --> 00:17:12.069
Felix (Geth): that's… I mean, we kind of want to… yeah, we want to have the versioning, but so far, also, it's been the case that people… when… when stuff is changed in the API, they… people want to have that on quite quickly. It doesn't really help anyone if we have a stable version, and then we're not really in a position to update it, like, frequently.

133
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:30.830
Zane Starr: Yeah, for sure. So, I would just recommend using GitHub Actions to then call the CLI to build the docs in the right place, in terms of, like, oh, we have this release, new release, boom, it goes into a particular folder, and that's it.

134
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.609
Zane Starr: I think the other thing that we were thinking about originally.

135
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.500
Zane Starr: Why is that? Oh, okay,

136
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:47.989
Zane Starr: Like, you're probably gonna have one doc, so it's potentially that you could start, like, get ignoring the folder, and then have that all be generated

137
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:56.829
Zane Starr: Sort of behind the scenes, so that's… that's, like, potentially a possibility, so that way, like, things are not just, like, ever-expanding.

138
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:13.810
Felix (Geth): Yeah, but I think the ever-expanding part is not really, like, bad. So we have this, the… currently, in the execution APIs, there is also a, like, GitHub pages branch, and that one contains the generated docs. And so, I mean, it…

139
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.010
Felix (Geth): It does kind of, like, we already have the auto-deployment set up there.

140
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.020
Felix (Geth): Right?

141
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:36.060
Zane Starr: No, so, like, the GH pages change between versions, so now it uses GitHub Actions pages. So GitHub Actions pages, like, puts the docs parallel to, the actual, like, process itself.

142
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:49.529
Zane Starr: So, there is a checked-in version of the docs themselves, that reflect the current state. So, different consumers, like, MetaMask and Infura.

143
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:55.680
Zane Starr: From times before, had problems where people were not able to really figure out, like.

144
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:14.120
Zane Starr: What's going on with the docs, or make suggestions for edits, so it was useful for them to be able to visualize that, at a glance, and say, like, oh, it's this line here, we don't like this kind of markdown, even though the markdown's generated from the descriptions with inside of the methods.

145
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.719
Felix (Geth): Okay. I'm still not really sure, so where is… do you know… I'm sorry.

146
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:31.050
Felix (Geth): Do you… can you tell me where is the current… Let's actually just check this.

147
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.930
Zane Starr: Yeah, sure. One second.

148
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:35.940
Felix (Geth): Okay.

149
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.130
Felix (Geth): Yeah, so we have this deploying… we have a deploy to GitHub pages.

150
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.770
Felix (Geth): Yeah.

151
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.789
Zane Starr: Yeah, so GitHub workflows…

152
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:55.960
Zane Starr: Then you look at deploy.yaml, and then, you'll see this. Let me just pull this up real quick.

153
00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.540
Zane Starr: But…

154
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:57.930
Felix (Geth): Yeah.

155
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:06.000
Zane Starr: So that's the deploy to the YAML, and so between V2 and V4. So many years ago.

156
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:24.950
Zane Starr: GitHub Actions was new, and it would require you to have a GHPages branch, and the GHPages branch would then, like, do the deploy, and then that would use DocuSource and all this other stuff. But, GitHub just, like, got rid of all of that, so you could just basically…

157
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:31.660
Zane Starr: Use GitHub Actions to deploy pages without needing, like, a separate branch and branch management and all of that stuff.

158
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:39.570
Felix (Geth): Yeah, but so where does the… thanks for giving me the tutorial about that, but where is this…

159
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.500
Zane Starr: Docs API, and then API.

160
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.790
Zane Starr: And that has all of the stuff.

161
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.260
Zane Starr: So, it looks like this…

162
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:04.150
Zane Starr: And that's, like, where the methods are, and then they get generated.

163
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:16.979
Zane Starr: So, like, this is supposed to just be so that way, like, okay, let's say that you are, from the UX perspective, someone that.

164
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:26.209
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I'm also sorry, my question was a different one. Basically, in order for… in order for us to, build

165
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:34.460
Felix (Geth): mostly, I think I'm not that familiar with this, like, way of deploying GitHub pages, which is, just…

166
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.320
Felix (Geth): Doesn't use the repository itself as a kind of storage for the files.

167
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:49.130
Zane Starr: So, I was just mostly curious, like, where do the actual, like, files live that are deployed to the GitHub pages? Okay, so line 44 of the deploy…

168
00:21:49.480 --> 00:22:08.160
Zane Starr: It's called, like, Upload Artifact, and then Actions Upload Pages Artifact, and it says with build, so in the background, npm run build docs creates a build directory, and the staging area of the CI, and then from there, it will copy that

169
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:13.750
Zane Starr: Where you see, on line 44, Actions Upload Pages Artifact.

170
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:25.970
Zane Starr: With the build, and then that is where the pages actually live. And then on GitHub and the background, I don't know if they just, like, throw it on their own, like, data center?

171
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:36.950
Zane Starr: or they take that, where it says it needs, like, the build, and then that's, like, where the built artifacts live, and are hosted by GitHub.

172
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:45.039
Felix (Geth): Yeah, so what I… mostly what I'm trying to get at is that if we actually want to use the versioning feature from DocuSaurus, we need to…

173
00:22:45.600 --> 00:23:02.629
Felix (Geth): have some place that contains all of the versions, and they all have to be in the same, so we basically have to keep adding to that storage. It's not like we cannot fully overwrite the pages storage every time. We have to check out the current version of the pages.

174
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:10.160
Felix (Geth): and modify it. So at that point, it might make sense to switch back to this, like, GitHub pages as a Branch approach.

175
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.979
Zane Starr: I actually don't think it does.

176
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.860
Felix (Geth): Okay. From my perspective.

177
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:20.220
Zane Starr: The thing that you would do, you could write your tooling script in any sort of language you want.

178
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:27.140
Zane Starr: in, like, shell script, or you could write it in TypeScript, or you could write it in Go.

179
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.629
Zane Starr: But I would then just, like, Through that, I would,

180
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.310
Zane Starr: simply not use the npm run build docs.

181
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.210
Zane Starr: Trying to figure out, like.

182
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.229
Zane Starr: What's the script that's running again?

183
00:23:47.180 --> 00:24:01.010
Zane Starr: And the package JSON… do… So… let's see… They build… ba-ba-ba… So there's the make-build script…

184
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.259
Zane Starr: And then the bill… It's in the source…

185
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:20.879
Zane Starr: I'm just looking for the proper, thing, but you… you don't need to do all of that, because, again, underneath the hood, it's all just,

186
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.100
Zane Starr: like, scripts?

187
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:34.339
Zane Starr: And we have the CLI, so the only thing you would do is download the GitHub releases. We actually have done this in the past with, like, our meta schema.

188
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:43.339
Zane Starr: which we're moving away from, but you can use the GitHub API to get the release versions that you want, or get all of the releases, then you build the docs.

189
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:57.940
Zane Starr: by calling the CLI on that directory. That directory then produces the markdown, and then you can, just have that output into the build, in the file location that DocuSource likes.

190
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:04.619
Felix (Geth): I understand. But then, basically, this means that on every single build, we have to download all of the past releases, and then, like.

191
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:23.680
Felix (Geth): build it that way, but what I meant is that if we were to use this GitHub pages as a branch approach, we can just check out the current version of the docs, add something to it, like, make the necessary modifications, and then also commit that, which is actually going to make it way easier to see the changes that are created by the build.

192
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:36.559
Felix (Geth): Whereas, in the other way, it's kind of like we're treating it more like the deployment is basically gonna be this thing that we cannot really inspect too well. I mean, you can run it locally, I guess, but…

193
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.750
Zane Starr: Yeah, so…

194
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.989
Felix (Geth): It's not really the same. So we… anyway, let's cut it short.

195
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.369
Zane Starr: Cut it short, yeah. There's a way.

196
00:25:44.130 --> 00:26:03.280
Felix (Geth): There are some stuff to figure out for this build, that is gonna make it possible to host, like, all the versions simultaneously of the docs, and basically, it comes with some update to the GitHub Pages build, however we do it, but this update has to be developed.

197
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.869
Felix (Geth): In order to make this happen.

198
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.060
Felix (Geth): I think.

199
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:20.129
Zane Starr: Yeah, yeah, it could be developed. The other approach is to just generate the versions into the current repo, which is, like, also an approach that would also give you the same caching.

200
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:33.479
Zane Starr: But it just depends on, like, how you feel about that, etc. And then, the other thing about that is only the files that are changing will then update the docs, so if you were to go to, like, one…

201
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:42.899
Zane Starr: well, not quite, because on the versions, then you haven't checked in. So maybe a branch approach is, like, a good approach, and, like, I don't know, so…

202
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:52.500
Felix (Geth): I mean, we'll figure it out, anyways. Okay, so this is like the… basically, in order to fully finish this API versioning.

203
00:26:52.870 --> 00:27:05.059
Felix (Geth): topic, we have to update the docs build to be aware of the versioning, and I think that's, like, that's kind of a slightly bigger task, but I'll find someone to do this, so that's fine.

204
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:15.499
Felix (Geth): I just wanted to mention that, for me, this kind of comes with the versioning. I mean, we can make a GitHub release with the V1 API, but it doesn't really help anyone. That's mostly what I wanted to mention here.

205
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:30.790
Felix (Geth): I mean, the main thing this does is then the… ultimately, we're gonna create that GitHub release very soon. In the immediate next step, we're going to update the tests to be running on top of this version, which is gonna make it easier for the clients, and we will have some kind of

206
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.089
Felix (Geth): method for…

207
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:43.840
Felix (Geth): running both the latest tests and the latest release tests, and then, as a… in the third step, we're gonna look into updating the docs build to be

208
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.270
Felix (Geth): aware of the versions, so this is the summary.

209
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.399
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, noted. Thank you very much.

210
00:27:53.980 --> 00:28:02.270
Zane Starr: Oh, I was gonna say, I had one other question for Felix. Felix, for the test files on the .ios.

211
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:11.570
Zane Starr: Would it be useful for you if the .io files were a part of the docs, and then went through the same sort of validation as…

212
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:17.070
Zane Starr: The rest of the… Methods.

213
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:24.429
Zane Starr: Because, like, I think right now, it's like, oh, if you generate this .io, but it doesn't actually correspond to the methods,

214
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.990
Zane Starr: It essentially is, like, a possibility.

215
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:34.090
Felix (Geth): No, no, no, we check, there is a job that actually checks the I.O. files for validity, so that.

216
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:39.470
Zane Starr: Spec check, right? But you wouldn't need spec check, potentially.

217
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.020
Zane Starr: If the .io files were already…

218
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:52.569
Zane Starr: and the doc, because that would be self-validating with the validation of the tools, potentially. That's… that's like a route, but…

219
00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:59.199
Felix (Geth): I don't think this could be related too much. Basically, I think we are going to be releasing the tests as part of the…

220
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:12.660
Felix (Geth): we're gonna be releasing the tests as part of the versioned release as well, so the release is gonna contain the OpenRPC.json file and the tests that are matching that version.

221
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.850
Felix (Geth): So that's how I see it for now. And then we can… we'll see how… where to go from there.

222
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.979
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, Denise, I don't know, Samus, do you have any updates in regards to the error?

223
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.070
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Code standardization.

224
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.460
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Freight.

225
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:43.999
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah. I saw the comment from, Felix, I looked into it. I have a few questions,

226
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:53.739
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: It's not questions. I did… I understand, Felix's point of view. My hesitation is,

227
00:29:53.750 --> 00:30:06.779
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: We will lose the, native validation functionality for error groups, if we don't embed the X error groups, the extension specification within the JSON.

228
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:16.259
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: So I wanted to just get some opinion from Felix, what's the reservation here, and how we can address it.

229
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:31.079
Felix (Geth): Yeah, mostly. I mean, from my point of view, it's just that we decided to rebuild the… we decided to recreate the spec build functionality because we see it as more, like.

230
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.959
Felix (Geth): An easier way for us forward to just…

231
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:41.240
Felix (Geth): be in control of the YAML input format in the repository, and so…

232
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:48.790
Felix (Geth): it's just kind of… that was, like, the main motivation for us to make these changes. And I think when it comes to the error codes, I…

233
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:55.749
Felix (Geth): I sort of understand this ex-error Group stuff, but… At the same time.

234
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.509
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, I just feel like it's…

235
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.589
Felix (Geth): I don't know, it just makes the spec more complicated in some way.

236
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.400
Felix (Geth): So…

237
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.350
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah.

238
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:16.260
Felix (Geth): If we will… I have no problem with, like, labeling the errors as groups, but to be honest, I don't think anyone really cares about these groups too much. Like, for people… I mean.

239
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:27.019
Felix (Geth): mostly what we've been looking for is a way to just have, like, arrow codes defined at all for the standard methods. And so, for me, this is kind of the more important thing.

240
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.680
Felix (Geth): And…

241
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.590
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah.

242
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.890
Felix (Geth): With regard to the, like…

243
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:43.359
Felix (Geth): groups, we have to see. I mean, we can update our tool to support this arrow group stuff, and then it will just be in the spec. Like, that's… I'm fine with that. I don't think there's, like, any issue with this.

244
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:51.489
Felix (Geth): it's just that, yeah, well, I mean, we have to make this update. So that's… that's… that's the main thing. So I would say.

245
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:52.020
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I understand.

246
00:31:52.020 --> 00:32:01.379
Felix (Geth): like, the next step is basically we have to implement support for the… for the errors inside of our tool. However we do it, basically, it has to be implemented.

247
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:07.649
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Right, right. Yeah, I saw you move the scripts from JavaScript to Go.

248
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:26.369
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, I think we should… I should definitely do it, because I wanted to make sure if, if I'm doing the right way of doing it, you know, so we don't have to re-implement everything. Because, one of your comments, the concerns were, we're still using references and it's not flattened.

249
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.140
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But it's already dereferenced, it's already flattened.

250
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.059
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I can actually show the generated,

251
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:41.410
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: OPA, sorry, generated, OpenRPC file. Let me just share for one moment.

252
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.629
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

253
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.769
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: If that… if that would make it easier.

254
00:32:44.770 --> 00:33:02.549
Felix (Geth): No, I mean, maybe we just misunderstood each other. So, we generate two versions of the spec right now. We have this… we have one file that we generate, it's called refs-openrpc.json, and that one includes all of the references. So basically, it doesn't have any of this, like, JSON post-processing.

255
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:10.340
Felix (Geth): And then we have another version of the spec, the OpenRPC.json, which is kind of a flattened version, so this one doesn't have any schemas defined.

256
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:16.770
Felix (Geth): And all the schemas are inlined into the methods in a specific way, and also all of these, like, all of…

257
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:22.040
Felix (Geth): Schema feature is, processed by the tool.

258
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.910
Felix (Geth): And…

259
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:38.780
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yes, exactly. No, no, I definitely understand that. So, we have two files, one is intermediary, the other one is the final one, flattened and, dereference. The open… sorry, the Xera groups work exactly the same, in the

260
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:52.240
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: non-dereference, which is the, middle file, refs file, it has the refs, and the final open RPC, it is dereferenced. For example, if you say X, error group.

261
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:59.449
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I don't know what method this is, but you can see it is all dereferenced. It doesn't hold any…

262
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.760
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: references, and it has all the errors dereference. The only difference here is

263
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:22.219
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: it doesn't use the errors, the typical errors, that's because it doesn't support arrays of arrays in the… that's one. Second, that's the only change as far as the methods are concerned, so it is still pretty readable for the users when they look at the spec.

264
00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:25.330
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: They'll know exactly what errors are supported per method.

265
00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:30.510
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: At the end, I have appended the extensions. This is…

266
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:52.789
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Users don't need to worry about this at all. The only reason we kept the extensions here, we can actually remove it if you don't need it, because it's useless at this point for pretty much most folks. But the reason I still kept X extensions, the spec itself, within the dereferenced one, is because this now allows us to natively validate

267
00:34:52.790 --> 00:35:11.509
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: if any of the error messages or any error codes are violating the grouping. For example, if I specified, let's say, 799 for one of the errors, I can natively validate without any extra validation tools, using just OpenRPC validations to see if anyone has violated.

268
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:35.209
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Some developer tomorrow comes in and says… adds a number, that doesn't, fall within our ranges that we expect it to be, which can be easily validated without no… without any code… additional coding or tooling to validate these ranges violations. That's the only reason I kept it here, but otherwise, it is pretty much exactly what we would expect the…

269
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.740
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: rest of the spec to be.

270
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.130
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Other than this, you won't see any other…

271
00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.479
Felix (Geth): Maybe this is a quick comment, Darrell.

272
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.560
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah.

273
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:57.109
Felix (Geth): It is… since… this is kind of what I… what I was trying to say, is that since we are now in control of this, like, translation step within our repository, we can just create a tool that will check that the errors are right. We can do this check while we are building the spec.

274
00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:10.279
Felix (Geth): So we don't really need to embed this into the spec, because as far as we're concerned, we treat the spec as an output from the tool. So there's… we will never worry that, like, that late in the process, we will not worry about the invalidity of the spec anyways.

275
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:18.370
Felix (Geth): Because we expect that this translation tool from the YAML to the JSON can only produce a valid output, so it is supposed to basically…

276
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:22.460
Felix (Geth): Not… it cannot create invalid… spec…

277
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.460
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Okay.

278
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:43.839
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I see your point, because if you remember, we had the RPC Testion, which is also consuming this, downstream. Now this has been merged back into the same repo. Needed this validation, because in RPC Testion, I can also enforce additional

279
00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.330
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: validations.

280
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.149
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: With this, with this extension spec being written here.

281
00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:59.330
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Now I have to take a look at this, how this RPC testing will work and consume, because this allowed me to enable validations with multiple

282
00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:10.260
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: places, kind of felt like a really niche side effect of having the extension specification, and also the documentation is built in. I don't have to worry about

283
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:28.339
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: any modifications to the documentation, especially given there are too many errors per method now. It can… I don't know how it looks like now, but I think it'll have a good side effect of displaying this in the documentation, too, having it in a…

284
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:35.869
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Extension specification. But now, if you have to rewrite this to… to be in a pragmatic way.

285
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:50.629
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: we'll have to worry about a lot of things, like, how we would do these validations in our RPC testing, because then it'll be a lot of complicated, hard-coded logic testing for these, grouping.

286
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.360
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Which I kinda hated.

287
00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.950
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Which was, like,

288
00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:11.980
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: built-in. Now, since this is an, embedded, it's a built-in validation, which I liked the way how we… how it did, using the OpenRPCs, scripts. Now, this means, like, writing ugly, ugly, hard-coded, grouping somewhere.

289
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.439
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Which is why I hesitated.

290
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:30.849
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, ultimately, what we want is… ultimately, we want the input to the spec generation process to be kind of easy to write, so there is going to be some YAML file that defines these error groups, right? I mean, you have that now, probably.

291
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.499
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah, we do.

292
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.259
Felix (Geth): Yeah, so I mean, there is… somewhere, there is.

293
00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.050
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Hi, Mocha.

294
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:48.360
Felix (Geth): a file that contains these errors, and then this file, I mean, we basically have to process that, and we have to create, anyway, some code that will process this file to create the…

295
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:55.199
Felix (Geth): the OpenRPC JSON output. And I think during this process, we can apply any validation we want. For example, we can.

296
00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:09.679
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Oh, no, no, no, I'm not talking about the validation while generating OpenRPC, which is already done anyway, but if someone is consuming this to make some modification or to generate tests in any downstream applications, we can all.

297
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:27.989
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah, that is not supposed to happen, though. Like, nobody is supposed to, like, extend the spec, which was published already. Like, that… I'm not worried about these kinds of use cases at all. As far as we are concerned, we are producing the spec, and it is what it is. Like, we're not, like, concerned about someone modifying the spec that we have produced later.

298
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.900
Felix (Geth): Right? When would that be a use case?

299
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.490
Zane Starr: Actually…

300
00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:33.340
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: It doesn't…

301
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.270
Zane Starr: Yeah, go ahead.

302
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:41.450
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Sorry, yeah, I was, I was going to say just, even in RPC test gen, for example,

303
00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:48.620
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: it doesn't directly consume these, error codes. For example, nonce to low error.

304
00:39:48.640 --> 00:40:02.420
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: whatever the error that's returned by the get, or whatever the client within the RPC testion, we can also implement this if it falls out of range, which…

305
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:08.290
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: this… Side effect of, again, having the embedded, grouping.

306
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:22.529
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But I do see your point, how we can do it otherwise, but it just feels like a, you know, an ugly implementation of… or a hard-coded implementation of validations in multiple places here.

307
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.230
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, as far as I understand, like, in RPC test gen, we're not really going to…

308
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:38.019
Felix (Geth): validate any of this. Like, that's not… that's not really the point of it. Like, RPC testing is just supposed to capture the outputs from the clients.

309
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.140
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah, but… We'll have to implement.

310
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.480
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah.

311
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:56.920
Felix (Geth): We will have to implement some validation in the spec check tool for the errors. So in that case, what we have to do is we have to check that in the responses, they have… they are using one of the error codes which is listed for the method.

312
00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:13.230
Felix (Geth): So, again, this is not really related with the groups, it's just that the client is allowed for a specific method to return specific error codes, and there's a definitive list of error codes for each method that can be returned, and so the spec check tool at some point has to be extended to

313
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:18.269
Felix (Geth): Basically, recognize the method, and then recognize the set of allowable error codes.

314
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:29.599
Felix (Geth): I don't really see how this is related with this, like, inlining the extension schema into the OpenRPC.json, because in the OpenRPC.json, we have a list of errors, which is…

315
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:33.929
Felix (Geth): allowed for each method, and we can just validate that in spec check.

316
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:44.070
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I… yeah, okay, I'll have to go back and check which tool where it sat nicely, but…

317
00:41:44.070 --> 00:42:01.189
Felix (Geth): I do see your point, I'm just worried about re-implementing all this again. It's been open for a really long time, yeah, I mean, you don't really have to do this. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the main thing I'm seeing is that this PR has been open for a long time. I recognize that it's a bit annoying, but…

318
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:06.899
Felix (Geth): We just took our time to figure out, like, the right way to do this.

319
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.660
Felix (Geth): It's…

320
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:19.680
Felix (Geth): we can merge it as it is today, but I can tell you that there will be some changes to this thing, ultimately, to make it kind of, like.

321
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:37.049
Felix (Geth): work for us, and the way I see it, the main contribution in the error codes proposal is the list of the error codes themselves, and also their association with the methods. So that's kind of how I see it. Like, the precise way of, like, how these error codes are integrated into the spec.

322
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:51.890
Felix (Geth): I don't think it's, like, the important part there. And, I mean, definitely I or someone else at the F, we will be working on the tools to make it more supported, or whatever, or apply more validations, or… I mean, this is something that is definitely gonna happen.

323
00:42:52.360 --> 00:43:08.460
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely want to provide my support, not just for the sake of merging it. I want to definitely see it through all the way. Let's hear from Zayn. He helped implement the extension just for this, so…

324
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.470
Zane Starr: Well, not just for that, but still. I mean…

325
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.350
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, no, no, sorry, the other way around.

326
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.020
Zane Starr: A general extensions framework, so…

327
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:36.599
Zane Starr: The way that, like, we see extensions is a way of communicating, like, docs is a way of communicating, like, downstream, all the different people that consume it. So, when you're talking about, well, like, no one's gonna really modify these docs, kind of, in a way.

328
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:52.400
Zane Starr: I think downstream consumers have a hard time consuming the docs currently. Just kind of the way, because of the structure, I think because of the versioning that you were talking about, and the fact that things are not, like, well bundled together, so it makes it really hard to test.

329
00:43:53.890 --> 00:44:05.069
Zane Starr: And so, like, the way we saw the extensions is a way to allow people to, do things that would be useful for the spec before we actually make those, like.

330
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:22.719
Zane Starr: mainline and say, like, okay, this is definitively the way that everything's gonna be done, so we don't, like, break people, and we also allow for a lot of flexibility. So with the X error groups and X error codes, those are things that we had discussed for a long time, and then we said, okay, we're gonna make these, like.

331
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:27.879
Zane Starr: Official, so they're supported by docs, categories, and all that stuff.

332
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:33.379
Zane Starr: But, the main thing there is just, like,

333
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:37.989
Zane Starr: Like, from the spec check perspective, like, looking at the spec check code.

334
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:53.480
Zane Starr: There are a few things that are, like, not quite right about that. So, like, one is the JSON schema version that's supported is actually at odds with what's supported with OpenRPC itself. So the schema that's being validated is the wrong version.

335
00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:00.949
Zane Starr: So, that means that, like, certain patterns that are available in, like, JSON 2020 are not available in JSON Draft 7.

336
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.639
Zane Starr: So…

337
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:13.300
Zane Starr: That's, like, something to contend with. The other thing is, is that we're actually changing the metaschema types. So before, we were a lot, like, looser with the typing, and so now we're a lot more tight.

338
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:24.950
Zane Starr: So that's, like, another thing. And then, when it came to, like, sort of the .io files, so you've been talking about, like, bundling that with the release, and the release and the .io files are kind of separate.

339
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:33.409
Zane Starr: But then it's also bundling the entire, like, sort of package, and sort of package infrastructure as well, so then you have to kind of use RPC TestGen.

340
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:46.129
Zane Starr: There are companies out there, like in Europe, that take the execution APIs, like, documentation, and then they use the OpenRPC TestGen, like, native, test coverage.

341
00:45:46.330 --> 00:46:00.720
Zane Starr: Which then allows you to hit the RPC endpoints and then get back the responses, much like the .io file, but it uses the examples to then validate, so when a user is writing the doc.

342
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:12.509
Zane Starr: no matter, like, what it is that they're writing, it means that the validation for the doc goes through, the same OpenRPC, validations that's within the schema Utils.

343
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:19.429
Zane Starr: So, it all automatically, like, aligns that the responses that you're expecting to get back

344
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:39.620
Zane Starr: are the same, and then the other sort of thing about that is it allows you to hit your live endpoints with it. So, like, let's say that you had an Erigon client, or let's say the FlashBots RPC API, then when you're making requests, you're able to validate that your responses then match the thing that's within the test.

345
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:59.519
Zane Starr: And so, within the next, like, month, our team is actually scheduled to help, like, overhaul tests, so we would really actually like to meet with you, Felix. So that way we can figure out, like, what it is, the thing that you, like, sort of need, and, like, what would, like, work well.

346
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.500
Zane Starr: Alright.

347
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.050
Felix (Geth): Like…

348
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:09.000
Zane Starr: I'm not opposed to writing things in Golang to, like, make those things, like, mesh with the vision of that. It's actually what we proposed

349
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:21.780
Zane Starr: like, I don't know, 7 months ago? It's like, hey, do you want this in Goling, or what? So, that's… that's why I was saying that we should just meet with flight clients and, like, you together to just figure out, like, okay.

350
00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:30.189
Zane Starr: what do you need OpenRPC to do and, like, sort of help you with? And then, like, how can we, like, sort of help make that happen? Because ultimately.

351
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:43.279
Felix (Geth): I mean, we don't really need anything right now, to be honest. Like, that's the thing, is, I mean, we have our own toolchain, I think we are pretty happy with it, to be honest. I don't think we have to change it. The main thing is, there are these examples in the spec,

352
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:56.580
Zane Starr: But I think examples and tests are not the same. Yeah, that's why we want to add X test, which would be parallel to examples, which would then allow you to do, like, the testing flow that I think that you would like.

353
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:05.120
Felix (Geth): Yeah, but the thing is that with these tests, it's not that easy. Like, we have built our own infrastructure precisely because it has some…

354
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:15.489
Felix (Geth): it… it… it has some requirements, and I mean, one of these requirements is that for the testing of the…

355
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:33.810
Felix (Geth): spec, you also need to make sure that you're running the test against a very specific chain. Like, you can't just, like, have an arbitrary example, because you will never be able to verify the result. And that's the whole… that's… and then also, in order to do your testing for certain methods, it's actually not possible to just directly compare the response.

356
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:42.620
Felix (Geth): And that's… that's, like, the whole other thing. Like, we have already kind of figured out, like, how to do our testing in a way that is, like, a good compromise, and I don't think that we really…

357
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.180
Felix (Geth): like…

358
00:48:44.420 --> 00:49:02.950
Felix (Geth): I don't think there's, like, too much that can be improved, with this. There is a separate project right now at the EF, trying to come up with, like, a performance-oriented testing method, but this is also fully unrelated, because again, for the performance testing, it has very different requirements from the conformance testing, which we are doing,

359
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.010
Felix (Geth): With these I.O. files.

360
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:12.520
Felix (Geth): And so, I mean, from my point of view, I think our setup is pretty good, and I don't really see how it would have to be changed.

361
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.719
Felix (Geth): Definitely, let's have that meeting, but…

362
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.759
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, I'm coming from a position where I think, like.

363
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:29.919
Felix (Geth): we are pretty well covered. There are certain things that can be improved in these tools, like, for example, the spec check tool could be improved a little bit, or… I mean, we can always have more tests, and…

364
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:34.839
Felix (Geth): Like, expand the coverage of the existing tests, or we can…

365
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:53.889
Felix (Geth): Yeah, but I think, for example, bundling the tests into the spec is… I don't see it as the correct approach, to be honest, because the tests are very specific to, like, the setup that we are using also with the test chain and everything, so then it's kind of like, if you have these… like, the tests stand alone are kind of useless. They only really work

366
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.450
Felix (Geth): together with.

367
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:57.099
Zane Starr: All the chain out…

368
00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:04.369
Zane Starr: PRLP, that you have the historical state, so that way you can reproduce that from the perspective of, like.

369
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:10.089
Zane Starr: Geth, right? So it's like, oh, here's the chain state, and you can't do anything without the chain state.

370
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:11.040
Zane Starr: Right.

371
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:22.970
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, for the current test, we have a definitive chain that we use, and all of the clients are loading that specific chain, and then we have test vectors that match this specific chain, yeah.

372
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:31.930
Felix (Geth): And, I mean, I'm pretty happy to go over it with you, like, how it actually, like, all works if you want, but I think we have a really good setup that works

373
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:43.220
Felix (Geth): really well. Like, in terms of how companies could use this to test their endpoints, like Infora, I'd be curious, like, I'm pretty sure they can just run the same setup that we have.

374
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.839
Felix (Geth): To test their own, like, software.

375
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:50.990
Felix (Geth): Because it's written in a way that is very,

376
00:50:51.530 --> 00:51:06.209
Felix (Geth): it's… it is very reproducible, but yeah. I mean, I agree, it's… I mean, at some point, one of the things we're gonna add to the testing is just, like, a… basically, we're gonna move the library that is the, like, interpreter of these I.O. files, we're probably gonna move that into the…

377
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:17.169
Felix (Geth): into the Golang tools directory in the spec as well, so that people can just import it from there. And then it's like, if you write your tests in Go, you can basically also have the validation of the tests

378
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:21.100
Felix (Geth): Like, the way we do it in our… in our conformance testing, and…

379
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:30.699
Felix (Geth): I think that's some… that's gonna be another step that helps people if they wanna be a downstream consumer of our tests. They can… they can use this library or whatever, I don't know.

380
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:32.930
Felix (Geth): Like, that's how I see it.

381
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:33.960
Zane Starr: Oh, cool.

382
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.949
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I have a question. Wouldn't this, have an impact in Hive?

383
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:45.090
Felix (Geth): I mean, yeah, that's the thing, I mean, we have this… we have some… some… what I was talking about just now is that

384
00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.280
Felix (Geth): there is…

385
00:51:46.630 --> 00:52:02.310
Felix (Geth): code in Hive that interprets the tests and compares the results, and this is where, ultimately, the testing really happens. Like, the test gen is just the creator of the test, it doesn't actually verify anything. The actual verification is done when these tests are executed against the client.

386
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:09.860
Felix (Geth): And that code, like the code that actually runs it against the client and compares the result, we can make… we can move that back into the…

387
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:17.310
Felix (Geth): into the specification repository also, and… but it's still, like, ultimately, we're still going to be running the tests in Hive, and…

388
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:36.790
Felix (Geth): is… is not… we're not really gonna change our approach, I think, for the conformance testing. It's just that the… the tools right now are a bit spread over multiple things, and I mean, the first thing we did is we have moved the test generation into the spec repository with the RPT test gen, and basically.

389
00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.509
Felix (Geth): the running of the test will remain in Hive, but we can definitely make it easier for

390
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:50.610
Felix (Geth): like, external projects to run the tests in a similar way by at least providing a library that kind of makes it easier, like, that's how I see it.

391
00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:05.850
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so, based on this, I don't know, are we still having discussion to further this, or do I need to open a trend so that we can have everything in a more compact form?

392
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.989
Felix (Geth): Sorry, I didn't catch the question, really. Can you, can you, can you…

393
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:22.280
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: No, I was asking Zane if he… because he was saying he wanted to talk to you on my client, so I was asking if it would make sense to open a train so that we would have, like,

394
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:29.089
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: a unified place we can reach consensus on this, or maybe a pointer.

395
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:36.659
Zane Starr: Where do you need to open a chain? Like, on… like, email? No, I was just… on GitHub?

396
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:44.220
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: No, like, on, on, yeah, on, what's it called? It's Magician, or the, Discord channel.

397
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:49.050
Zane Starr: Shh… Sure, I guess, which…

398
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:53.680
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: No, I was just trying to, like, so that we don't… if the discussion happens…

399
00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:56.180
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yes, that's what, that's what…

400
00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.489
Zane Starr: Yeah, I think we were scheduled to meet with light clients.

401
00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.330
Zane Starr: Barely soon, probably?

402
00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:10.580
Zane Starr: So… I think we can just, like, coordinate, like, just meeting, just to, like, get everything straight and, like…

403
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.250
Zane Starr: Figured out, yeah.

404
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.939
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think I'll handle it.

405
00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:16.100
Zane Starr: that, it's okay. Yeah.

406
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:21.209
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, okay. So, based on that, I think we are, like, 5 minutes…

407
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:30.140
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: extra time, and I wanted to actually walk, through something with Felix. I think I'll have to, like, create a trend for that also.

408
00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:37.489
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And I might target to it. There's some, like, open and stealth PRs and issues I would like to walk through with you, so that.

409
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:39.189
Felix (Geth): We'll be able to figure out…

410
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:46.549
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Are you okay doing it now? I'm just looking at the time, we have, like, 5 minutes left.

411
00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:58.290
Felix (Geth): It's okay, I mean, yeah, I mean, this is part of the agenda. We got a bit lost in the whole discussion, but I think it was also kind of necessary after the big update that we pushed to discuss this.

412
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:04.409
Felix (Geth): Because it affects the error code so much, that's why I think it was very helpful to talk it over.

413
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:11.020
Felix (Geth): Let's go through the… let's go through the… through the PRs.

414
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:12.700
Felix (Geth): That you have.

415
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.810
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: some are here in this, other issue I opened.

416
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.430
Felix (Geth): Yo.

417
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:33.839
Felix (Geth): So the… Stalled… are we talking about the stalled PRs, or are you talking about the…

418
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.350
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, distort PRs.

419
00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.850
Felix (Geth): Mmm…

420
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:47.219
Felix (Geth): Yeah, one second, I think it might be good if I share my screen for this, and then we can click through them.

421
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:56.550
Felix (Geth): One second… I just have to… Figure out my tabs here.

422
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.410
Felix (Geth): There we go.

423
00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:16.450
Felix (Geth): Okay Yeah, okay, so here is the… is the agenda.

424
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.920
Felix (Geth): First one… oh, sorry, maybe should open in tab.

425
00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.800
Felix (Geth): Back, sorry.

426
00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:28.570
Felix (Geth): Here, okay, so first one…

427
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:33.439
Felix (Geth): GraphQL test cases from Hive. I don't fully…

428
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:49.390
Felix (Geth): I mean, this is somewhat unrelated. This is about the GraphQL test. This PR is trying to basically make it so the GraphQL tests are also in line. The problem is that the GraphQL tests in general are very outdated, and

429
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:57.240
Felix (Geth): I think we can't really… We can basically only just close this.

430
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:18.469
Felix (Geth): the other problem is that the GraphQL API in general is a bit unmaintained right now. I mean, nobody is really looking into any issues there, and it kind of has some… it has the parallel tooling to the RPC, but we are not really actively… I mean, we maintain the endpoint and Geth, but…

431
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:25.239
Felix (Geth): I don't think anyone really uses it. So, I would say this thing, I mean, it was nice, but…

432
00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:33.479
Felix (Geth): realistically, I think the next step for us is just to remove the GraphQL. I don't think we're really maintaining it.

433
00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:46.270
Zane Starr: Were you able to get any stats on usage before? Just, like, a casual query on, GraphQL, on the endpoints, in code out there?

434
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.160
Zane Starr: Just curious.

435
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:53.739
Felix (Geth): I mean, we do not… we don't have any telemetry in the client, so we cannot actually check if anyone's using it.

436
00:57:53.740 --> 00:58:13.440
Zane Starr: So, I just meant on GitHub, like, so one of the approaches we took was to look back, over the last 3 years through commit messages for, whether or not someone was using the code, and it kind of gives you back a cursory stat that, like, oh, no one's at least made a PR, that many.

437
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:18.980
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, we can check… we can definitely check if someone is using it, yeah.

438
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:35.479
Felix (Geth): But I just think it's pretty unlikely. So let's go to the next… like, this GraphQL thing, we have to figure out some other time. So, we can… from my point of view, we can also go, like, a couple minutes over, like, it's okay, because we have to go through these things.

439
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:40.849
Felix (Geth): So, next one is this default location.

440
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:45.010
Felix (Geth): I have no idea.

441
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:55.429
Felix (Geth): this is… this is, again, very old. Someone is trying to… define the…

442
00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:00.490
Felix (Geth): canonical location of the engine API. I think this chip has kind of sailed.

443
00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:09.570
Felix (Geth): It's… this was supposed to be in the… Initial spec, but it…

444
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:14.870
Felix (Geth): never really happened, and I think now it's kind of like we would have to bring it up on…

445
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:21.430
Felix (Geth): ACD, I mean, it has come up on ACD a couple times before, But…

446
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:26.740
Felix (Geth): Nobody has really been in a position to say, yeah, we have to do this.

447
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:46.869
Felix (Geth): And I feel like the RPC standards is kind of the wrong forum to make this call, because ultimately this has to be implemented inside of the consensus layer clients, and inside of the execution clients, and it's not like an API change, it's just like a config change. So they have to… we have to bring it up on ACD again. I think that's the next step for this one.

448
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:54.920
Felix (Geth): Same with the next one about the secret, it's also just, like, an engine API config thing.

449
00:59:55.510 --> 01:00:01.610
Felix (Geth): TX pool, standardization, Yeah.

450
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.089
Felix (Geth): It's a big topic.

451
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:10.349
Felix (Geth): So, this one would require us to go through the…

452
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.530
Felix (Geth): yeah, basically it just adds a bunch of methods. I think we have to figure out

453
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.410
Felix (Geth): This is something where we would have to…

454
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:39.189
Felix (Geth): create, like, an EIP, so this would be the next step for this one, because it has to be discussed in the same way that all the other new methods. It's basically adding new methods to the spec, and as far as I understand, these methods are not really implemented.

455
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.439
Felix (Geth): in any client. So, we would have to… Figure this out.

456
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.249
Felix (Geth): I'm not really seeing any…

457
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:59.319
Felix (Geth): too many comments. I mean, there's this guy, he's… I think he's in the Bisu client, but we would have to bring it up more formally to… to really,

458
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.880
Felix (Geth): Make a decision on that.

459
01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.769
Felix (Geth): Yeah, we have to check the logs of the call to see how that went. Same with the receipt proof, it's also something…

460
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:20.940
Felix (Geth): Yeah, like, all of these PRs are just stuck because they are spec changes that have to go through the process, and they haven't really…

461
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.660
Felix (Geth): Gone through the process.

462
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.370
Felix (Geth): So… yeah.

463
01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:38.690
Felix (Geth): I don't really know what we can do to these PRs to make them unstuck. Basically, people… clients have to come on the call to discuss these… these methods and to come to a decision, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, that's how…

464
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.410
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I have a question. So,

465
01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:50.370
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: let's say I decide to, like, take this up to ACDE or ACDT, and I want.

466
01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:50.920
Felix (Geth): Hmm?

467
01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.909
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: then how do I, like,

468
01:01:53.020 --> 01:02:07.429
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: continue the process. If… if by some miracle they decide to go with any… any of them, do I need to open a fresh PR, or do I need to tag the authors, of the PR? Because it's been long, and then I'm not sure how…

469
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:17.540
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: available they would be to continue the discussion or to continue the work, actually, in case of any PR changes or some light work on the PR itself.

470
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:35.299
Felix (Geth): So, the way I see it is that you have actually been really good at this process. If you occasionally come on ACD and propose one of these things, the main thing is, it's good to occasionally remind the clients that there are open proposals on the RPC, and if you…

471
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:44.089
Felix (Geth): put it just right, where you're like, hey, you know what, guys? I have this little proposal, can you just vote on it right now? Chances are, it works. We saw that last time.

472
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:48.280
Felix (Geth): With the, with the, with the thing where they added the…

473
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:51.229
Felix (Geth): What was it? It was the block timestamp?

474
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:53.730
Felix (Geth): I think we can go… we can see it here.

475
01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:06.960
Felix (Geth): So, I would say this was a… This was a…

476
01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:25.969
Felix (Geth): this is an example where this approach worked really well. So, basically, this was opened, someone put it on the… I mean, you put… you had it on the RPC standards, we discussed it a little bit. At some point, you mentioned it in the ACDE, and then more people came and gave their statement.

477
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:41.079
Felix (Geth): And then it was pretty clear at some point that, yeah, I mean, we can just merge this, because every client just gave their statement. And it's just, like, I think in this particular case, you did a really good job of just, like, pinging the clients once in ACDE, and that was enough to make everyone vote.

478
01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:52.200
Felix (Geth): If we come with 10 proposals, they're not really gonna vote, but if we come with, like, let's say one proposal per ACDE, we're always gonna say, hey, you know what, guys? Here's a little proposal, just vote on that right now. And I think

479
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:57.319
Felix (Geth): That way, we can make progress through these proposals. At the same time.

480
01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:10.130
Felix (Geth): I would say that it might also make sense to start fresh with these proposals and not try to revive the old PR, especially because all of these old PRs are somehow…

481
01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:15.900
Felix (Geth): They… first of all, they require rebasing in some cases, but also, sometimes they are just…

482
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:22.189
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I mean, it's just like they have a lot of baggage, and if…

483
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:36.960
Felix (Geth): if someone comes to this PR, they will… they will be really confused, because this PR, for example, has, like, 10… it has, like, 20 comments on it. So, we're not really expecting people to read the comments. What we're expecting from the clients on ACD is to go to this page.

484
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.660
Felix (Geth): Check out the new spec, and say, oh yeah, that looks reasonable, we could implement that, and then give their vote.

485
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.449
Felix (Geth): So I think it makes sense for us to…

486
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:57.179
Felix (Geth): basically just recreate these PRs again, in a way where they can be applied, and then in this case, for example, also, they wouldn't really need these script changes anymore.

487
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:15.489
Felix (Geth): maybe, or, I don't know, we have to see how that all works out, but basically… and also, maybe we wouldn't add the tests right away, we would just add the methods and then come up with the tests later, so that way we would have a really small PR that they can just give a quick glance, and then we can get to a…

488
01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:28.850
Felix (Geth): we can get to somewhere. And then for some things, if there are larger changes, we may even want to consider creating, like, an EIP. But I don't think it really makes sense to try and, like, ping these authors who…

489
01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.180
Felix (Geth): Did something years ago, and to try to get them to

490
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.869
Felix (Geth): continue the work on that PR.

491
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:46.610
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you. I'll try and, like, make a proper list, and then start introducing them one after the other.

492
01:05:46.610 --> 01:06:00.799
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: perhaps, like, make fresh PRs for them, then I will start introducing them one after the other. But before then, when I do a PR, I'll tag it to it so that you can take a look then. For the next, ACDH, for that week, we'll kind of, like, I'll…

493
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.259
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: ask for… Clients' opinion on it.

494
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:12.100
Felix (Geth): Yeah, that's great. I think that way we will actually make some progress, and I mean, you can… when you recreate the PR, you can also just…

495
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:25.890
Felix (Geth): make a link to the old PR saying that basically this is a resubmission of these changes that were proposed earlier, so if people are interested, they can take a look, but I don't think people are really interested in digging through all of this old stuff. Like, this is…

496
01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.400
Felix (Geth): Is… they are… basically don't really have the time for that, or not the capacity.

497
01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:48.200
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, great. We made some progress over here, and I'm hoping by this we can reduce some PRs and then some issues also.

498
01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:58.290
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hmm… I don't know if there's any other thing.

499
01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:02.079
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Because this is all I have for my end,

500
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:08.160
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Adi Boyer and, Ahmad. I don't… this is, I think, my first time seeing you guys here.

501
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:25.549
Ahmad: knowing how Ethereum works. Yeah, so apologies on the camera front, can you guys hear me? Hello? Oh, oh, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, so, so I think it, it's not my first time, but I haven't really…

502
01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:41.589
Ahmad: I've kind of just joined, like, a fly on the wall, on, like, maybe one or two other calls. But, anyway, just to introduce myself, my name is Ahmad, Wilson. I've been in this space for quite a bit, started mining, and validating, back in the day. I'm currently head of infrastructure at OTem Labs.

503
01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:51.829
Ahmad: We're a Web3, company built on top of EIP7702, so account delegation. And so…

504
01:07:51.830 --> 01:08:08.340
Ahmad: really into orchestrators, have worked, just, again, being in infrastructure, have dealt with a lot of, client, deployments, and, whether or not there are validator nodes, execution layer clients, clients across all the different types of EVMs, even Solana, Bitcoin.

505
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:20.269
Ahmad: So most of my experience, really, revolves around that. Let me turn this down, target you guys. I'm also hopping into the, protocol studies, like.

506
01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:32.349
Ahmad: study group, cohort or so that's beginning today. So that's pretty sweet, there. But, but yeah, I'll wrap it up. Have… have been pretty, pretty committed.

507
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:52.689
Ahmad: To the, Ethereum ecosystem, for… for quite a bit, have worked within the system for… or within the space for quite a bit as well, and, am looking to hopefully become a regular to this call and contribute where I can. Just like with before, when we were talking about, the, the spec generation.

508
01:08:52.770 --> 01:09:09.200
Ahmad: excuse me, the, the spec versioning, and then also the error, error, spec generation. Those are things right up my alley at, you know, that's kind of what you, you would think, like, CICD, DevOps, infrastructure, that's, those are things that we do. We have, we handle quite a bit for…

509
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:21.079
Ahmad: APIs for microservices, for example, or different types of services. So, so yeah, I'm looking forward to learning more, and, and work with you guys more. Hopefully you'll see me on…

510
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:38.189
Ahmad: on calls regularly, and, and then I'll quickly add, I posted in the chat, that I would be… I'm always up for, a walkthrough, so Felix, Zane, Mercy, Simpson, Raj, any of you guys,

511
01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:54.129
Ahmad: if you're, if you're up for it, I, I'm super cool with just, like, sending you a DM or so to walk through, like, some of the more fundamental, like, at least starting with, like, the more fundamental, base, tools and processes, just so I can, you know, get more familiar.

512
01:09:54.130 --> 01:10:00.870
Ahmad: But, but yeah, I'll definitely always appreciate it anytime that people would be willing to invest. But yeah, I'll wrap it up right there. Thanks, you guys.

513
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:09.149
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thanks for the introduction, and it's a pleasure having you here, and also hoping for you to contribute more, and then…

514
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.699
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Attend more calls with us, and…

515
01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:16.920
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I think that's for my end,

516
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:24.850
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Are we calling it a wrap? Is there any other thing? Thank you, Felix, for, the pointers, and then for always being here.

517
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.719
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And also,

518
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:36.950
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I think that's all for today. See you guys next two weeks, probably. I'll make a list.

519
01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:51.690
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'll do a course summary for what we discussed today, and then for the backlogs and for the versioning we talked about on the website issue, we highlighted as a blocker for this. And that's all from my end. Thank you guys for joining.

520
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.710
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Have a nice evening.

521
01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.379
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Thank you, Rod. Bye-bye.

522
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:58.120

523
01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:58.750
Ahmad: Cool, excellent.

524
01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:00.219
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thanks. Thanks, Felix.

525
01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:00.680
Ahmad: shows.

526
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:01.340
Zane Starr: Peace.

527
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.340
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Bye.
